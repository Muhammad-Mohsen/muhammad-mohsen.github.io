The Lord has clothed and girded Himself with strength; for He has established the world, which shall not be moved. Your throne is prepared from the beginning; You are from everlasting. The rivers have lifted up, O Lord; the rivers have lifted up their voices; the rivers shall lift up their voices, from the voices of many waters. The billows of the waves of the sea are wonderful; the Lord is wonderful in the highest. His testimonies are very sure; holiness is worthy of Your house, O Lord, unto length of days.
