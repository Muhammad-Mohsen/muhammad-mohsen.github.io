Serve the Lord with gladness; come into His presence with exultation. Know that the Lord Himself is our God; He made us, and not we ourselves; we are His people, and the sheep of His pasture. Enter into His gates with thanksgiving, and His courts with praise; give thanks to Him, praise His name. For the Lord is good; His mercy is forever, and His truth is from generation to generation.
