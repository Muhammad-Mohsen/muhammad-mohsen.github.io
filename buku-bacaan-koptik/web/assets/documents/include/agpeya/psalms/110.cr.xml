Great are the works of the Lord; examined are all His wills. Majesty and splendor are His works, and His righteousness endures forever and ever. He has made a remembrance of all His wonders; the Lord is merciful and compassionate. He has given food to those who fear Him; He shall remember His covenant forever. He has declared to His people the power of His works, to give them the inheritance of nations.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            Ø£Ø¹ØªØ±Ù?Ù?Ù? Ù„ÙƒÙŽ ÙŠØ§Ø±Ø¨Ù‘Ù?
