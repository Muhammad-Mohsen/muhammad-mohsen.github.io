O Lord, I beseech Your guidance in this matter. Do not let me follow my tendencies, if it will cause me to be confused and fall. Keep me from slipping, help me, and let it be according to Your will. If You see it fit, grant me Your blessing to complete it. If not, remove this desire from my heart. You know all things, nothing is concealed from You, Lord I am Your servant, deal with me as You see fit, as I realize that I will have neither success nor peace unless I submit myself to Your will. Teach me to say in every occasion, â€œLet it be according to Your will, Lord, not according to my own.â€? For Yours is the kingdom, the power, the glory forever and ever.

Grant me that I may ask and wish always for what is pleasing to You. Let Your will be my will. Let my will follow always Your will and be in accord with it in a perfect way. Let both of us have one will, for I donâ€™t want to desire anything except what You want and what You wish.         </Language>      </Text>            <Text>         <Language id="English">            Grant me not to lust for the things of this world, that I may dwell in You in all things and hold above all things the desire to be as You would have me be and to do as You would have me do. You are the peace of my heart and the shelter of my life. You are the real peace and the only comfort and apart from You everything is hard and confusing. Therefore, in this peace which is in You, the Great Eternal Good, I am able to rest. For Yours is the kingdom, and the power and the glory forever.           </Language>      </Text>   </Section></Document>
