We should not be negligent or postpone them from one time to another. We must persist in doing what we are required to do in meekness and humility as long as we are able, so that we would be considered obedient rather than sinful. The prayers and the fasting required were imposed by the disciples to remind us, at all times, of the pain and suffering of our Lord Who died on the cross to redeem us from the death of sin. He completed His sacrifice on Friday night as the evangelist said, â€œNow when evening had comeâ€? which means when Friday was over and Saturday eve had started. This indicates that the suffering of the Lord started on the eve of Friday and ended on the day of Friday and that is why the disciples imposed fasting and prayers on that day. We must honor that day with charity, mercy, and humility remembering what the Lord endured in terms of humiliation and suffering to save us.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            Ù„Ù‚Ø¯ ÙŠØ¬Ø¨ Ø¹Ù„ÙŠÙ†Ø§ Ø£Ù† Ù†ÙƒÙˆÙ† Ù…ØªÙŠÙ‚Ø¸ÙŠÙ† Ù?ÙŠ Ø£ÙˆÙ‚Ø§Øª Ø£ØµÙˆØ§Ù…Ù†Ø§.
