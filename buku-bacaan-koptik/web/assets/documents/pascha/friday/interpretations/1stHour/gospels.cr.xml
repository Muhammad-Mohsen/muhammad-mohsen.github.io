Pontius Pilate was their governor as representative of the Roman Emperor, Tiberius. When the Jews arrested Jesus, brought Him to the High Priestâ€™s house at night, and condemned Him to death, they could have executed their judgment. However, fearing the anger of the Jewish people, they decided to deliver Him to Pilate to rid themselves of the responsibility of killing Him, â€œAnd when they had bound Him, they led Him away and delivered Him to Pontius Pilate the governorâ€?         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            ÙƒØ§Ù† Ø§Ù„ÙŠÙ‡ÙˆØ¯ Ù?ÙŠ Ø§Ù„Ø²Ù…Ù† Ø§Ù„Ø°ÙŠ Ø¸Ù‡Ø± Ù?ÙŠÙ‡ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø³ÙŠØ­ Ø¹Ù„Ù‰ Ø§Ù„Ø£Ø±Ø¶ Ø®Ø§Ø¶Ø¹ÙŠÙ† Ù„Ù„Ø­ÙƒÙ… Ø§Ù„Ø±ÙˆÙ…Ø§Ù†ÙŠ.

First, perverting the nation, which is obviously false because the Lord Christ always promoted love, to the forgiveness of trespasses and bearing offenses. Since Pilate had already heard about the teachings of Christ in this regard, he gave no attention to the first accusation. The second fold of the accusation can also be divided into two points. First, that He was encouraging the people not to pay taxes to Caesar. This was a lie since Pilate heard that Jesus said, â€œRender therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's,â€? The second point regarding the â€œKingâ€? terrified Pilate and concerned him.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            ÙˆØªØ´ØªÙ…Ù„ Ù‡Ø°Ù‡ Ø§Ù„Ø´ÙƒØ§ÙŠØ© Ø¹Ù„Ù‰ ØªÙ‡Ù…ØªÙŠÙ†: Ø§Ù„Ø£ÙˆÙ„Ù‰ Ø¥Ù?Ø³Ø§Ø¯Ù‡ Ø§Ù„Ø£Ù…Ø© ÙˆÙ‡Ø°Ù‡ Ø¨Ø§Ø·Ù„Ø© Ù…Ù† Ø·Ø¨Ø¹Ù‡Ø§ Ù„Ø£Ù† Ø§Ù„Ø³ÙŠØ¯ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø³ÙŠØ­ ÙƒØ§Ù† Ø¯Ø§Ø¦Ù…Ø§ ÙŠØ­Ø« Ø¹Ù„Ù‰ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø­Ø¨Ø© ÙˆØ§Ù„Ø¥ØºØ¶Ø§Ø¡ Ø¹Ù† Ø§Ù„Ø¥Ø³Ø§Ø¡Ø© ÙˆØªØ­Ù…Ù„ Ø§Ù„Ø£Ø°Ù‰.

Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly glad; for he had desired for a long time to see Him, because he had heard many things about Him, and had hoped to see Him do some miracles done. However, the Lord had no purpose except to die for us. He also knew that Herod just wanted to see a miracle for amusement.

So when the devil noted Judasâ€™ love for silver, he made him steal from the box that was in his possession, to the extent that he was upset at the woman who rubbed the feet of the Lord with an expensive perfume wishing that the cost of the perfume would have gotten into the box so that he could dip into it. When the Lord rebuked the disciples who agreed with Judasâ€™ corrupt opinion, Judas resented the Lord even more and hated Him enough to deliver Him into the hands of the Jews. But when he saw Him condemned to death he regretted what he had done and returned the silver pieces. When the devil sensed his regret, he made him think that his deed could not be forgiven except if he killed himself. He therefore made for himself a hanging device on a high place. He put the rope around his neck and hanged himself but the rope did not tighten enough around his neck to kill him. He continued to breathe in but not out. He became inflated and was in a very miserable condition. Because of his disturbance, the rope broke and he fell to the ground, â€œand falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out.â€? He lost his life on earth and in the age to come and fulfilled the words of the Bible, â€œWhen he is judged, let him be found guilty, And let his prayer become sin Let his days be few, And let another take his office Let his children be fatherless, And his wife a widowâ€?         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            ÙˆØ§Ù„Ù…Ù?Ù‡ÙˆÙ… Ø£Ù† ÙŠÙ‡ÙˆØ°Ø§ ÙƒØ§Ù† Ø¶Ù…Ù† ØªÙ„Ø§Ù…ÙŠØ° Ø§Ù„Ø³ÙŠØ¯ Ø§Ù„Ø¥Ø«Ù†ÙŠ Ø¹Ø´Ø± ÙˆÙƒØ§Ù† ØµÙ†Ø¯ÙˆÙ‚ Ø§Ù„Ù†Ù?Ù‚Ø© Ø¹Ù†Ø¯Ù‡.

This verse indicates that the chief Priests of the Jews realized their error and realized that the silver Judas returned could not be accepted as offerings, â€œAnd they consulted together and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in itâ€? they did this to hide their evil deed under the pretext of strangers, â€œTherefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day,â€? because with its price they bought the blood of Christ and killed him. â€œThen was fulfilled what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying, "And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the value of Him who was priced, whom they of the children of Israel priced, and gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord directed me."â€? The prophet had already foretold of this evil that the Jews willingly committed. We ask our Lord to make us always unconfident of ourselves so that we do not fall into sin and that we continuously cling and hold onto the faith in His name and our hope in Him.
