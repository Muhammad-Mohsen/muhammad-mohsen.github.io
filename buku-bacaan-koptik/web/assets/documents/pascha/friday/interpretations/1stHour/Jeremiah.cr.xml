In this verse, Jeremiah did not address one person but the whole nation whom he warned about God, as is apparent in his saying, â€œYou were resisting the truth for sometime with your fatherâ€? , which means that in their youth they were evil because they followed their fathersâ€™ abominable ways. They fought the truth, ignored the words of the prophets, and banished them and when they grew old; they did not teach their children and expected them to be ignorant. The prophet also prophesied about their children who talked about themselves with satisfaction saying, â€œIf we had lived in the days of our fathers, we would have not been partakers with them in the blood of the prophetsâ€? and when the God of all prophets came to them and they saw Him perform great miracles never performed by any other prophet and despite their knowledge of the prophecies of the prophets that He is their Savior they did not believe Him.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            "Ø«Ù… Ù‚Ø§Ù„ Ø£Ø±Ù…ÙŠØ§Ø¡ Ù„Ù?Ø´Ø­ÙˆØ±" Ù„Ù… ÙŠÙ‚Ù„ Ø§Ù„Ù†Ø¨ÙŠ Ù‡Ø°Ø§ Ø§Ù„Ù‚ÙˆÙ„ Ù„Ø´Ø®ØµÙ?
