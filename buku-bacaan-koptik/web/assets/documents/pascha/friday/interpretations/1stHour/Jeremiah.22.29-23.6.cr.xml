The prophet was not speaking to the land but to the people. He ordered them to listen to the word of God uttered on his tongue. He said, â€œWrite you this man an outcastâ€? By â€œthis manâ€? he meant the kings of the Israelites and although he is speaking about one â€œmanâ€? his words apply to all. By describing the men as â€œoutcasts,â€? he indicates that they sinned against the Lord and that the prophets have testified against them. He said, â€œfor there shall none of his seed at all grow up to sit on the throne of David or as a prince yet in Judah,â€? meaning that after the coming of Jesus Christ, none of the descendants of the Israelite kings became a king.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            Ù‚Ø§Ù„: "ÙŠØ§ Ø£Ø±Ø¶ ÙŠØ§ Ø£Ø±Ø¶ Ø§Ø³Ù…Ø¹ÙŠ ÙƒÙ„Ù…Ø© Ø§Ù„Ø±Ø¨".
