By heaven and earth, he means its inhabitants for as the angels inhabit the heavens and hearken to the Lordâ€™s words and follow Him in fear and trembling so should the people who inhabit the earth. They also should hearken to Godâ€™s words and memorize them. He said, â€œI have begotten and reared up children, but they have rebelled against Me.â€? In this verse, He refers to the descendants of Israel whom He had chosen from among all the nations to be a loving Father to them. He gave them power over their enemies but they disobeyed Him and delivered their Savior to His death.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            Ù‚Ø§Ù„: "Ø§Ø³Ù…Ø¹ÙŠ Ø£ÙŠØªÙ‡Ø§ Ø§Ù„Ø³Ù…ÙˆØ§Øª ÙˆØ£ØµØºÙŠ Ø£ÙŠØªÙ‡Ø§ Ø§Ù„Ø£Ø±Ø¶ Ù?Ø£Ù† Ø§Ù„Ø±Ø¨ Ù‚Ø¯ ØªÙƒÙ„Ù…" ÙŠØ¹Ù†ÙŠ Ø¨Ø§Ù„Ø³Ù…ÙˆØ§Øª ÙˆØ§Ù„Ø£Ø±Ø¶ Ø¹Ù† Ø³Ø§ÙƒÙ†ÙŠÙ‡Ø§.

By â€œAh,â€? He meant woe to the Jews because they have thought evil of their Savior. He described them as â€œan evil seedâ€? not because they are the evil descendants of Abraham but of their father Satan because they were born of him since they obeyed him and did his will. He also said, â€œYou are of your father the devil, and the desires of your father you want to doâ€? teaching us that those who do evil are born of the devil and those who do virtue are born of God. The origin of virtue is belief in our Lord, Jesus Christ as St. John clarified to us, â€œWhoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, â€œand he also said, â€œWhoever has been born of God does not sin, for His seed remains in him; and he cannot sin, because he has been born of Godâ€? He said â€œlawless childrenâ€? because they had violated Godâ€™s commandments and followed the teachings of the devil.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            Ù‚Ø§Ù„: "ÙˆÙŠÙ„ Ù„Ù„Ø£Ù…Ø© Ø§Ù„Ø®Ø§Ø·Ø¦Ø© Ø§Ù„Ø´Ø¹Ø¨ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ù…ØªÙ„Ø¦ Ø¥Ø«Ù…Ø§Ù‹" Ø£ÙŽØ¹Ø·Ù‰ Ø§Ù„ÙˆÙŠÙ„ Ù„Ø´Ø¹Ø¨ Ø§Ù„ÙŠÙ‡ÙˆØ¯ Ù„ØªÙ?ÙƒÙ?Ø±Ù‡Ù?
