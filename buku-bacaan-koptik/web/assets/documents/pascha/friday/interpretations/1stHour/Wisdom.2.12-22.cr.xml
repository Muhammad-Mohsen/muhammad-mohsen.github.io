They followed Him to find a fault in Him and entrap Him because they wanted to maintain their position as leaders; their hearts were never able to comprehend what the Lord did. They used to say that whatever He did was from the devil despite their knowledge that this is the truth. The Holy Bible testifies against them saying, â€œNevertheless even among the rulers many believed in Him, but because of the Pharisees they did not confess Him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue; for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of Godâ€?.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            Ù‚Ø§Ù„: "ÙˆÙ„Ù†ÙŽÙƒÙ…Ù?Ù†Ù’ Ù„Ù„ØµØ¯ÙŠÙ‚ Ù?Ø£Ù†Ù‡ Ø«Ù‚ÙŠÙ„ Ø¹Ù„ÙŠÙ†Ø§".

Because when He performed His miracles and they did not believe, He ordered them to read and search in the books of their prophets saying, â€œYou search the Scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life; and these are they, which testify of Me.â€? Jesus not only ordered them to read the scriptures but to search it to understand the meaning of the prophetsâ€™ words which show that He is their Savior.

They fight those who deal unjustly with them whereas Christians turn their cheeks to those who slap them because of their love for Jesus.
