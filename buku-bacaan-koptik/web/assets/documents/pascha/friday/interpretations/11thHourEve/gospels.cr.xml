But at last two false witnesses came forwardâ€? They were called false witnesses because their testimony was dishonest- they said, "This fellow said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God and to build it in three days. "They lied because the Lord did not say I will destroy the temple, but He said you destroy the temple, â€œBut He was speaking of the temple of His body.â€? He did not mean the stone temple that is why their testimony was false. As David the Prophet had prophesied, â€œFierce witnesses rise up; They ask me things that I do not knowâ€?.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            ÙˆÙ„Ù…Ø§ Ø£Ø¯Ø®Ù„ÙˆØ§ Ø§Ù„Ø±Ø¨ Ø¥Ù„Ù‰ Ø¯Ø§Ø± Ø±Ø¦ÙŠØ³ Ø§Ù„ÙƒÙ‡Ù†Ø© Ù„ÙŠÙ„Ø§Ù‹ ÙˆØµØ§Ø±ÙˆØ§ ÙŠØ·Ù„Ø¨ÙˆÙ† Ø­Ø¬Ø© ÙŠÙˆØ¬Ø¨ÙˆÙ† Ø¹Ù„ÙŠÙ‡ Ø¨Ù‡Ø§ Ø§Ù„Ù…ÙˆØª.

He was taught that due to his pride in acknowledging his master he fell into denying Him. Third, when God saw him feeling superior to the other disciples and confident of his own courage and determination not to deny the Lord, the Lord left him so that he would learn that without the heavenly care and providence he would not be able to fulfill his words and promises.

God also wanted to show us that He would take good care of us if He sees our sincerity in belief and intentions. As for Peterâ€™s exiting and bitter tears, they show us his great regret and his sincere seeking of forgiveness. Therefore, he was absolved from his sin of denial unlike Judas who when he regretted what he had done lost hope of forgiveness and immediately the devil overcame his mind and led him to commit suicide. Therefore, we must be careful not to fall into the devilâ€™s trap. If we fall, we must quickly recover like Peter by repenting and requesting forgiveness so that our repentance is accepted as Peterâ€™s was because God is merciful. Glory be to Him.
