When man was thrown out of Eden, his body and soul resided on earth. Upon death, the body resides in a house and the soul in another. The body resides in a grave and the soul resides in Hades; but our God visited man in all three. In each visit, he took our form. He visited those living on earth in a human body and with a soul like them. He visited the dead bodies in a dead body in a grave, like them. As for those who were in Hades, He appeared to them as a human being and delivered them.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            Ø¥Ù†Ù†Ø§ Ø¨Ù…Ø¹ØµÙŠØ© Ø¢Ø¯Ù… ÙˆØ£ÙƒÙ„Ù‡ Ù…Ù† Ø§Ù„Ø´Ø¬Ø±Ø© ØµØ±Ù†Ø§ Ù†Ù†Ø²Ù„ Ø«Ù„Ø§Ø«Ø© Ù…Ù†Ø§Ø²Ù„.

They corrupted the earth and made it vile. God sent them the prophets to guide them back to the virtuous path and to urge them to avoid sin and wickedness but the prophets failed in doing so. They only managed to save themselves from sin and that is why the Son of God and the second Person of the Holy Trinity came to earth in the body of a man. He resembled us in every aspect except sin. He lived on earth a holy and a perfect life showing us the plan that had been set but that we had not followed and demonstrating that it is possible for those who chose to please their Creator to live in perfection in this life.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            ÙˆØ°Ù„Ùƒ Ø£Ù† Ø¢Ø¯Ù… Ù„Ù…Ø§ Ø®Ø±Ø¬ Ù…Ù† Ø§Ù„Ù?Ø±Ø¯ÙˆØ³ Ø¥Ù„Ù‰ Ø§Ù„Ø£Ø±Ø¶ ÙˆØªÙ†Ø§Ø³Ù„ Ù…Ù†Ù‡ Ø§Ù„Ø¬Ù†Ø³ Ø§Ù„Ø¨Ø´Ø±ÙŠ.

Overpowered by their desires, they sentenced Him to death because His ways did not agree with their works. He tolerated unbelievable humiliations and tortures demonstrating for us forgiveness, even to those who wrong us. He asked God to forgive those who crucified Him while He was on the cross and they were mocking Him. When the hour came and He gave His spirit, He descended into Hades with His divine nature and delivered those captured there.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            ÙˆÙ„ÙƒÙ† Ø§Ù„ÙŠÙ‡ÙˆØ¯ Ù„ØªÙˆØºÙ„Ù‡Ù… Ù?ÙŠ Ø§Ù„Ø¢Ø«Ø§Ù… Ù„Ù… ÙŠÙ‚Ø¨Ù„ÙˆØ§ Ù…Ù†Ù‡ Ø§Ù„ÙˆØ¹Ø¸ ÙˆØ§Ù„Ø¥Ø±Ø´Ø§Ø¯ Ù„ØªØºÙ„Ø¨ Ø§Ù„Ø£Ù‡ÙˆØ§Ø¡ Ø¹Ù„ÙŠÙ‡Ù….

The Lord Christ died at the ninth hour, which was the time the Jews made their evening offering in the temple and the priest offered incense in the Holy of Holies while the people prayed outside. Behold the veil was torn in two, as a sign of the destruction of the temple and the laws of Moses. It also indicated they blasphemed against their God. The Jews used to tear their garment when they heard a blasphemy. â€œAnd the earth quaked, and the rocks were split,â€? because of the danger and the immense horror of the crucifixion. Its danger disturbed even the inanimate objects. The sun covered its light so as not to see the sufferings of the Lord Christ and the earth trembled at the grave sin of its inhabitants. The quaking of the earth was like the shaking of vessel at sea; threatening the hypocrite. â€œThe rocks were splitâ€? indicating that the crucified was the Creator and that the inanimate grieved His suffering while the hearts of His tormentors were still hard and cruel. Since the tongues that were supposed to praise and glorify Him became dumb and silent, the inanimate rocks screamed, praising and glorifying the Lord. Our Lord Jesus Christ referred to this saying, â€œI tell you that if these should keep silent, the stones would immediately cry out.â€? In several cases, God had rebuked the speaking using the dumb as Balaamâ€™s donkey rebuked him and the splitting of the altar and the pouring out of the ashes rebuked Jeroboam.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            ÙˆÙƒØ§Ù† Ø°Ù„Ùƒ Ù„Ù†ÙˆØ¹ÙŠÙ†: Ø§Ù„Ø£ÙˆÙ„ Ø¹Ù„Ø§Ù…Ø© Ø¹Ù„Ù‰ Ø®Ø±Ø§Ø¨Ù‡ Ù?ÙŠÙ…Ø§ ÙŠØ£ØªÙŠ Ù…Ù† Ø§Ù„Ø£ÙŠØ§Ù… Ø¹Ù„Ù‰ Ø£ÙŠØ¯ÙŠ Ø§Ù„Ø±ÙˆÙ…Ø§Ù† ÙˆØ§Ù„Ø«Ø§Ù†ÙŠ Ø¯Ù„Ø§Ù„Ù‡ Ø¹Ù„Ù‰ Ø¥Ø¨Ø·Ø§Ù„ ÙƒÙ‡Ù†ÙˆØª Ø§Ù„ÙŠÙ‡ÙˆØ¯ ÙˆÙ‚Ø±Ø§Ø¨ÙŠÙ†Ù‡Ù… ÙˆÙ†ÙˆØ§Ù…ÙŠØ³Ù‡Ù… ÙˆØ§Ù†ØªØ²Ø§Ø¹ Ù†Ø¹Ù…Ø© Ø§Ù„Ù„Ù‡ Ù…Ù†Ù‡Ù….

Both signify His general and specific power to resurrect the dead. When He said, â€œthey are saints,â€? He meant that their testimony was valid. He said, â€œand coming out of the graves after His resurrection, they went into the holy city and appeared to manyâ€? showing that their graves were opened when He gave up the spirit and they were resurrected after His resurrection to announce His resurrection among their families. After those saints had accomplished their mission, they returned to their graves because the time for the general resurrection had not come except for Jesus Christ as St. Paul said, â€œthe firstborn from the dead, that in all things He may have the preeminence.â€? Note that when Jesus screamed and gave up the spirit four wonders took place: the veil was torn, the earth quaked, the rocks were split, and the dead were raised. If we add darkness at six, then we have five wonders.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            ÙˆÙ‚ÙˆÙ„Ù‡ Ø¹Ù† Ù‡Ø¤Ù„Ø§Ø¡ Ø®Ø§ØµØ© Ø£Ù† Ù‚ÙˆÙ…Ø§Ù‹ Ø¥Ù„Ù‰ Ø­ÙŠØ§Ø© Ø§Ù„Ø£Ø¨Ø¯ ÙˆÙ‚ÙˆÙ…Ø§Ù‹ Ø¥Ù„Ù‰ Ø¹Ø°Ø§Ø¨ Ù…Ø¤Ø¨Ø¯ ÙŠØ¯Ù„ Ø¹Ù„Ù‰ Ø§Ù„Ù?Ø±Ù‚ Ø¨ÙŠÙ† Ù…Ù† Ø£Ù‚Ø§Ù…Ù‡Ù… ÙˆÙ‚Øª Ø¥Ø³Ù„Ø§Ù…Ù‡ Ø±ÙˆØ­Ù‡ ÙˆØ¨ÙŠÙ† Ù…Ù† Ø³ÙŠÙ‚ÙŠÙ…Ù‡Ù… Ø¹Ù†Ø¯ Ø¥ØªÙŠØ§Ù†Ù‡ Ø§Ù„Ø«Ø§Ù†ÙŠ.
