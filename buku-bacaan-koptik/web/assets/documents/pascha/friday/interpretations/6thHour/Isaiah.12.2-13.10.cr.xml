Formerly, they had not understood Jesusâ€™ explanation to them concerning His life giving passion. On another level, the prophet foresaw the crucifixion of the Lord as the father of all fathers, Abraham, had seen it and rejoiced. It was as if he had witnessed it and therefore he said, â€œBehold, God is my salvation.â€? He was assured that Jesus was the Savior of the world and therefore he said, â€œI will trust, and not be afraid,â€? which means that after the truth was revealed to the believers in His holy name, they left everything behind and relied upon Him fully fearing neither poverty nor death.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            Ù‚Ø§Ù„: "Ù‡ÙˆØ°Ø§ Ø§Ù„Ù„Ù‡ Ø®Ù„Ø§ØµÙŠ" ÙŠØ¹Ù†ÙŠ Ø¨Ù‡Ø°Ø§ Ø£Ù† Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø¤Ù…Ù†ÙŠÙ† Ø¨Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø³ÙŠØ­ Ù„Ù…Ø§ Ø±Ø£ÙˆÙ‡ ÙŠÙˆÙ… Ø§Ù„ØµÙ„Ø¨ÙˆØª Ø§Ù„Ø¹Ø¸ÙŠÙ… ÙˆØ§Ù„Ø¹Ù„Ø§Ù…Ø§Øª ÙˆØ§Ù„Ø¢ÙŠØ§Øª Ø§Ù„ØªÙŠ Ø­Ø¯Ø«Øª.
