However, should the freed slave willingly sell himself to another master he becomes the property of another. His first master can no longer release him from captivity against his will otherwise he becomes unjust. The same principle applies to Adam, who was created free and with free will. He misused his freedom when he disobeyed his Creator, succumbed to the devil, and became his slave.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            Ø£Ù† Ø§Ù„Ø¹Ø¨Ø¯ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ù…Ù„ÙˆÙƒ Ø¥Ø°Ø§ Ø¹ØªÙ‚Ù‡ Ø³ÙŠØ¯Ù‡ ØµØ§Ø± Ø­Ø±Ø§ Ù„Ù†Ù?Ø³Ù‡ ÙˆÙ„ÙƒÙ†Ù‡ Ø¥Ø°Ø§ Ø¨Ø§Ø¹ Ù†Ù?Ø³Ù‡ Ø¨Ø¥Ø±Ø§Ø¯ØªÙ‡ Ù„Ø³ÙŠØ¯ Ø¢Ø®Ø± Ù?Ø£Ù†Ù‡ ÙŠØµÙŠØ± Ù…Ù…Ù„ÙˆÙƒÙ‡.

God is infinite and invisible. He has no like and no example, light from light, simple in all aspects. He fills the heaven and the earth, above all thoughts, words, descriptions or comprehension. He also means by â€œimageâ€? manâ€™s dominion over all visible creation as God its Creator is its Master, its Owner its Lord.. By â€˜likenessâ€™ he means with purity and good deeds as our Holy God is all virtue and always works for our good. The discoveries, the inventions and the wonders of the world that the human mind processes and presents harnessing the natural elements and its strengths to serve himself and his kind is compelling rational evidence that God has made man master over visible creation supporting the biblical text when God told Adam explicitly and all men implicitly, â€œBe fruitful and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it; have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.â€? Those who contemplate the accomplishments of man in the former ages and in our current age, the age of wonders, admits without doubt that man is the master of nature and the king and ruler of all visible creation.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            Ùˆ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ù‚ØµÙˆØ¯ Ù…Ù† Ù‚ÙˆÙ„Ù‡ "Ø¹Ù„Ù‰ ØµÙˆØ±ØªÙ†Ø§ ÙƒØ´Ø¨Ù‡Ù†Ø§" Ù‡Ùˆ Ø£Ù† Ø§Ù„Ù„Ù‡ Ø®Ù„Ù‚ Ø§Ù„Ø¥Ù†Ø³Ø§Ù† Ø¹Ù„Ù‰ ØµÙˆØ±ØªÙ‡ Ù?ÙŠ Ø§Ù„Ø¹Ù‚Ù„ ÙˆØ§Ù„Ù†Ø·Ù‚ ÙˆØ§Ù„Ø­Ø±ÙŠØ© ÙˆØ§Ù„Ø¨Ø± ÙˆØ§Ù„Ù‚Ø¯Ø§Ø³Ø© ÙˆØ§Ù„Ù‚ÙˆÙŠ Ø§Ù„Ø±ÙˆØ­ÙŠØ© Ø§Ù„Ù…ÙˆØ¬ÙˆØ¯Ø© Ù?ÙŠÙ‡ Ø¹Ø² ÙˆØ¬Ù„.

Warriors fight against their enemies therefore God permitted the devil, the worst enemy, to come into the garden of Eden and fight against Adam. Had Adam won, he would have been awarded the crown of eternal joy but when the devil came into Eden and saw Adam, he envied him, his glory and his dignity. He concealed himself in the serpent and tempted him until he disobeyed his Creator and ate the fruit of which he was forbidden.

As Satan had not used violence or force to enslave Adam but concealed himself in a serpent and tempted him until Adam disobeyed his Creator, so our Lord concealed Himself in the body of a man, hid His divinity from the devil, delivered Adam from his control, and gave him eternal life. Jesus planned that the Virgin Mary be betrothed to Joseph, the carpenter, and resides in his house before He was born of her. When she became pregnant, the devil thought Joseph was the father and did not notice Isaiahâ€™s prophecy, â€œBehold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a Son, and shall call His name Immanuel.â€? â€œwhich is translated, 'God with us.'â€? Had Satan realized this prophecy and understood it, Godâ€™s plan would not have materialized because he would not have dared come close to his Creator lest the fire of His divinity would burn him. When the Creator was incarnate, the devil assumed that He was an offspring of Adam and wanted to tempt Him to sin like all other men the children of Adam. Our Lord did not listen to him and further aroused his anger by His teachings and by urging the people to repent and quit sinning.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            ÙˆØ¨Ù…Ø§ Ø£Ù† Ø§Ù„Ø´ÙŠØ·Ø§Ù† Ù‚Ø¯ Ø§Ù?ØªØ®Ø± Ø¨Ø­ÙƒÙ…ØªÙ‡ Ø§Ù„Ø´Ø±ÙŠØ±Ø© Ù„Ø¥ÙŠÙ‚Ø§Ø¹Ù‡ Ø¢Ø¯Ù… Ù?ÙŠ Ù…ØµÙŠØ¯ØªÙ‡: Ø£Ø±Ø§Ø¯ Ø§Ù„Ù?Ø§Ø¯ÙŠ Ø§Ù„ÙˆØ­ÙŠØ¯ Ø£Ù† ÙŠØµÙ?ÙŠØ¯Ù‡ Ø¨Ø§Ù„Ù…ÙŽØµÙ’ÙŠÙŽØ¯Ø© Ø§Ù„ØªÙŠ ØµØ§Ø¯ Ø¨Ù‡Ø§ Ø¢Ø¯Ù… Ù„ÙŠØ®Ù„ØµÙ‡ ÙˆÙ†Ø³Ù„Ù‡ Ù…Ù† Ø³ÙŽØ¨ÙŠÙ?Ù‡ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ù?Ù‡Ù„Ù?Ùƒ Ø¨ØºÙŠØ± Ø¹Ø³Ù?

He kept murmuring in their hearts that if they do not kill Him, the Romans would annihilate them. Therefore, they agreed among themselves that if the people announced that Jesus was the Christ and the Romans got word that the coming of the Christ meant the displacement of their rule since the Christ will rule the Jews as King, they will undoubtedly destroy us. They thought, â€œIf we therefore accepted Him as King and offered Him the appropriate royal welcome, the Romans will definitely destroy us, therefore we have no alternative but to deliver Him and say that this man claims kingship over us but we do not accept Him and we brought Him over to you because we have no king but Caesar.â€?         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            ÙˆÙ‚Ø¯ ØªÙ…Ù„Ù‘ÙŽÙƒ Ù…Ù†Ù‡ Ø§Ù„ØºÙŠØ¸ ÙˆØ§Ù„Ø­Ù†Ù‚ Ø­ØªÙ‰ Ø¬Ø¹Ù„Ø§Ù‡ Ø£Ù† ÙŠØºØ±Ø³ Ø§Ù„Ø­Ø³Ø¯ ÙˆØ§Ù„Ø¨ØºØ¶Ø© Ù?ÙŠ Ù‚Ù„ÙˆØ¨ Ø±Ø¤Ø³Ø§Ø¡ ÙƒÙ‡Ù†Ø© Ø§Ù„ÙŠÙ‡ÙˆØ¯ ÙˆÙ…Ø´Ø§Ø¦Ø® Ø´Ø¹Ø¨Ù‡Ù… ÙˆØ¨Ù‡Ù…Ø§ Ø£Ø¹Ù…Ø§Ù‡Ù… Ø¹Ù† Ù…Ø¹Ø±Ù?ØªÙ‡ ÙˆØ£ØºÙ„Ù‚ Ù‚Ù„ÙˆØ¨Ù‡Ù… Ø¹Ù† Ù?Ù‡Ù… Ø£Ù‚ÙˆØ§Ù„ Ø£Ù†Ø¨ÙŠØ§Ø¦Ù‡Ù… Ø¹Ù† Ù…Ø¬ÙŠØ¦Ù‡ ÙˆØµØ§Ø± ÙŠÙˆØ³ÙˆØ³ Ù?ÙŠ Ù‚Ù„ÙˆØ¨Ù‡Ù… Ø¨Ø£Ù†Ù‡Ù… Ø¥Ø°Ø§ Ù„Ù… ÙŠÙ‚ØªÙ„ÙˆÙ‡ Ù?Ø¥Ù† Ø§Ù„Ø±ÙˆÙ…Ø§Ù† ÙŠØ¨ÙŠØ¯ÙˆÙ†Ù‡Ù… Ø¹Ù† Ø¢Ø®Ø±Ù‡Ù….

When the people realized what was happening to them they asked Moses to pray to God on their behalf. Then the Lord said to Moses, "Make a fiery serpent, and set it on a pole; and it shall be that everyone who is bitten, when he looks at it, shall live." They offered a sacrifice of a fiery flying serpent, which was said to have had two wings, like the wings of a bird protruding at its neck about a cubit. When flying, it would spread its wings and appeared in the shape of a cross. The serpent that Moses raised on a pole had two feathers stuck to its sides. All those who looked at it lived, foretelling the cross of Jesus Christ.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            ÙˆÙ…Ø«Ø§Ù„ Ø¢Ø®Ø± Ø¥Ù„Ù‰ Ø§Ù„ØµÙ„ÙŠØ¨ ÙˆÙ‡Ùˆ Ø£Ù†Ù‡ Ù„Ù…Ø§ ØªÙ‚Ù…Ù‚Ù… Ø§Ù„Ø´Ø¹Ø¨ Ø¹Ù„Ù‰ Ø§Ù„Ù„Ù‡ ÙˆØ¹Ù„Ù‰ Ù…ÙˆØ³Ù‰ Ù?ÙŠ Ø§Ù„Ø¨Ø±Ù‘Ù?ÙŠØ© Ø£Ø±Ø³Ù„ Ø§Ù„Ù„Ù‡ Ø¹Ù„ÙŠÙ‡Ù… Ø§Ù„Ø­ÙŠØ§Øª Ø§Ù„Ù…Ù?Ø­Ø±Ù?Ù‚Ø© Ù?Ù„Ø¯ÙŽØºØª Ø§Ù„Ø´Ø¹Ø¨ Ù?Ù…Ø§Øª Ù‚ÙˆÙ…ÙŒ ÙƒØ«ÙŠØ±ÙˆÙ† Ù…Ù† Ø¥Ø³Ø±Ø§Ø¦ÙŠÙ„ ÙˆÙ„Ù…Ø§ Ø¹Ø§ÙŠÙ† Ø§Ù„Ø´Ø¹Ø¨ Ù…Ø§ Ø­Ù„ Ø¨Ù‡Ù… ØµØ±Ø® Ø¥Ù„Ù‰ Ù…ÙˆØ³Ù‰ Ø£Ù† ÙŠØµÙ„Ù‰ Ø¥Ù„Ù‰ Ø§Ù„Ù„Ù‡ Ù…Ù† Ø£Ø¬Ù„Ù‡.
