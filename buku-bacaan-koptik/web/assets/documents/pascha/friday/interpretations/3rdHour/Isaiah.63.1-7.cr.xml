Out of envy, they told Nicodemus, who defended Jesus in front of them, â€œSearch, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.â€? By â€œEdomâ€? he also meant heaven as David said, â€œWho will bring me into the strong city? Who will lead me into Edom?â€? Both sayings are prophecies about Jesus Christ.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            Ù‚Ø§Ù„: "Ù…Ù† Ø°Ø§ Ø§Ù„Ø¢ØªÙŠ Ù…Ù† Ø¢Ø¯ÙˆÙ…".

He said, â€œmighty to saveâ€? meaning that judgment is in the hands of the Lord as the Holy Bible says, â€œFor the Father judges no one, but has committed all judgment to the Son.â€?         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            Ù‚Ø§Ù„: "Ø§Ù„Ù…ØªØ¹Ø¸Ù… Ø¨Ø¹Ø²Ø© Ù‚ÙˆØªÙ‡" ÙŠØ¹Ù†ÙŠ Ø¨Ù‡Ø°Ø§ Ù‚ÙˆØ© Ù„Ø§Ù‡ÙˆØªÙ‡ Ø§Ù„ØªÙŠ Ù„Ø§ ØªÙ?Ø±ÙŠ.
