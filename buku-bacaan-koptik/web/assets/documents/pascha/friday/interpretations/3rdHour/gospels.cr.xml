We started to work the ground, which had been cursed because of us and brought forth thorns and thistles as God had commanded. Years and generations had passed and we were still naked of righteousness until the Son of God, the second hypostasis of the Divine, condescended and was incarnate from the ever virgin Mary, the morning star, and lived amongst us, healing our sicknesses, raising our dead and giving sight to the blind. Envy filled the hearts of the Jewish priests and they hated Him. The devil tempted them to kill Him so they sentenced Him to death despite the fact that they could not execute this judgment because the Romans who ruled over them had denied the Jewish judges the right to kill any man. So they took Him to Pilate then to Herod then to Pilate again.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            Ø¥Ù†Ù†Ø§ Ù„Ù…Ù‘ÙŽØ§ Ø®Ù?Ù„Ù‚Ù†Ø§ Ù„Ù…Ù’ Ù†Ù?Ø®Ù„Ù‚ Ø¹Ù?Ø±Ø§Ø© ÙƒÙ…Ø§ Ù†Ø­Ù† Ø§Ù„ÙŠÙˆÙ… ÙˆÙ„ÙƒÙ†Ù†Ø§ ÙƒÙ†Ø§ Ù…Ù?ÙƒØªØ³ÙŠÙ† Ø¨Ù?Ø±Ø¯ÙŽØ§Ø¡ Ø§Ù„Ø¨Ø± ÙˆÙ„Ù…Ø§ Ø®Ø§Ù„Ù?Ù†Ø§ ÙˆØµÙŠØ© Ø§Ù„Ù„Ù‡ ØªÙŽØ¹Ø±ÙŠÙ†Ø§ Ù…Ù† Ù‡Ø°Ø§ Ø§Ù„Ø±Ø¯Ø§Ø¡ ÙˆØ®Ø±Ø¬Ù†Ø§ Ù…Ù† Ø§Ù„Ù?Ø±Ø¯ÙˆØ³ Ù…Ø­Ù„ Ø§Ù„Ø±Ø§Ø­Ø© ÙˆØ§Ù„Ù†Ø¹ÙŠÙ… Ø¥Ù„Ù‰ Ø£Ø±Ø¶ Ø§Ù„ØªØ¹Ø¨ ÙˆØ§Ù„Ø´Ù‚Ø§Ø¡ Ø¨Ø¹Ø¯ Ù…Ø§ Ø³ÙŽØªØ± Ø§Ù„Ù„Ù‡ Ø¹Ø±ÙŠÙ?Ù†Ø§ Ø¨Ø±Ø¯Ø§Ø¡ Ù…Ù† Ø§Ù„Ø¬Ù„Ø¯.

He was humiliated four times. He was declared innocent three times and was sentenced twice. When He was finally brought back to Pilate for the second time, Pilate tried to release Him several times because he was confident of His innocence but his efforts did not yield any results when he saw that the place was full of people and the mob was shouting for him to crucify Jesus. He therefore tried to come up with a solution that would pacify their anger and quench the envy in their heart. "You have brought this Man to me, as one who misleads the people. And indeed, having examined Him in your presence, I have found no fault in this Man concerning those things of which you accuse Him; no, neither did Herod, for I sent you back to himâ€¦ I will therefore chastise Him and release Himâ€¦ But they shouted, saying, "Crucify Him, crucify Himâ€?         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            Ù?Ù‚Ø¯ Ø³Ù?ÙŠÙ‚ Ø§Ù„Ø±Ø¨ Ø¥Ù„Ù‰ Ø§Ù„Ø­ÙƒÙ… Ø£Ù…Ø§Ù… Ø§Ù„Ù‚Ø¶Ø§Ø© ÙˆØ§Ù„ÙˆÙ„Ø§Ø© Ø³Øª Ù…Ø±Ø§Øª.

The Israelites had been enslaved by Pharaoh and were delivered at the same time of year that they celebrate the Passover. Therefore, when Pilate became their governor they agreed that he would release one captive each year at the time of Passover to show them mercy.) As for Pilateâ€™s wifeâ€™s dream, interpreters have disagreed on its meaning. A distinguished group of commentators agreed that she saw the Lord sitting on a throne and rising to heaven with great glory surrounded by the creatures of both the earth and the heavens and when she inquired about the scene, a fearful loud voice from Heaven replied, â€œThis is Jesus of Nazareth who was condemned by Pilate.â€? She suffered for him showing that she was scared by the enormity of what she saw.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            ÙˆÙ„Ù…Ø§ Ø±Ø£Ù‰ Ø¨ÙŠÙ„Ø§Ø·Ø³ Ø£Ù† ØªØ£Ø¯ÙŠØ¨Ù‡ ÙˆØ¥Ø·Ù„Ø§Ù‚Ù‡ Ù„Ø§ ÙŠØ±Ø¶ÙŠÙ‡Ù… ÙˆØ£Ù†Ù‡Ù… Ù„Ù… ÙŠÙ†Ù?ÙƒÙˆØ§ Ù…Ù† Ø§Ù„ØµØ±Ø§Ø® Ø·Ø§Ù„Ø¨ÙŠÙ† Ù‚ØªÙ„Ù‡.

And they smote Him with their hands.â€? By being scourged the Lord paid for the insults and the scourging that Adam and his offspring deserved. The soldiers humiliated Him after they had undressed Him. He was dressed in a purple robe instead of the leather robes given to Adam and Eve when they had fallen. A crown of thorns was put on his head instead of the thorns and thistles that He had ordered the earth to grow when Adam fell. He carried the thorns on His head to ensure that He carried our sins, for sins are thorns. Pilateâ€™s intention of showing them Jesus like this was to persuade them not to kill Him but they shouted even more, â€œBut they cried out, "Away with Him, away with Him! Crucify Him!" Pilate said to them, "Shall I crucify your King?" The chief priests answered, "We have no king but Caesar!"
