There are several reasons for this. First, Jesus wanted to spare the owners of the house where He had the Paschal Supper with His disciples, the evil of the soldiers who came with Judas from the Sanhedrin and the High Priests. Second, He did not want to be in a confined space so that people would know that nothing would prevent Him from running away, if He so chooses. Third, He wanted to show Himself in an open place where no man can hide. Fourth, Judas knew of this place because the Lord used to go there often to teach.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            ÙˆÙ„Ø³Ø§Ø¦Ù„ Ø£Ù† ÙŠØ³Ø£Ù„: Ù…Ø§ Ù‡Ùˆ Ø§Ù„Ø³Ø¨Ø¨ Ù?ÙŠ Ø®Ø±ÙˆØ¬Ù‡Ù… Ø¥Ù„Ù‰ Ø¬Ø¨Ù„ Ø§Ù„Ø²ÙŠØªÙˆÙ† Ù?ÙŠ Ø°Ù„Ùƒ Ø§Ù„ÙˆÙ‚ØªØŸ Ù?ÙŠÙ‚Ø§Ù„: Ø£Ù†Ù‡ Ø£Ø±Ø§Ø¯ Ø¨Ø°Ù„Ùƒ Ø¹Ø¯Ø© Ø£Ù†ÙˆØ§Ø¹: Ø§Ù„Ø£ÙˆÙ„ Ø£Ù†Ù‡ Ø£Ø±Ø§Ø¯ Ø£Ù† ÙŠØµÙˆÙ… Ø£Ù‡Ù„ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ù†Ø²Ù„ Ø§Ù„Ø°ÙŠ Ø¹Ù…Ù„ Ù?ÙŠÙ‡ Ø§Ù„Ù?ØµØ­ Ù…Ù† Ø´Ø± Ø§Ù„Ø¬Ù†Ø¯ ÙˆØ§Ù„Ø´Ø±Ø·Ø© Ø§Ù„Ø°ÙŠÙ† ÙŠØ­Ø¶Ø±Ù‡Ù… ÙŠÙ‡ÙˆØ°Ø§ Ù…Ù† Ø¹Ù†Ø¯ Ø±Ø¤Ø³Ø§Ø¡ Ø§Ù„ÙƒÙ‡Ù†Ø© ÙˆÙ…Ø´Ø§ÙŠØ® Ø´Ø¹Ø¨ Ø§Ù„ÙŠÙ‡ÙˆØ¯.

Because Peter loved Him most, He was quick to blunder saying, "Even if all are made to stumble, yet I will not be." Jesus wanted to put an end to his boasting and pride amidst his brethren, and answered him, â€œI say to you that today, even this night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny Me three times." He came to know his weakness and was no longer full of self-confidence and pride. Peter was not the only one to sin but encouraged all the other disciples to say as he did which shows us that self-reliance is the beginning of downfall.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            ÙˆÙ‚Ø¯ Ø³Ø¨Ù‚ Ù?Ù‚Ø§Ù„ Ù‡Ø°Ù‡ Ø§Ù„Ù†Ø¨ÙˆØ© Ø¹Ù„Ù‰ Ù„Ø³Ø§Ù† Ø²ÙƒØ±ÙŠØ§ Ø§Ù„Ù†Ø¨ÙŠ.

The devil had asked Him to allow him to enter into a herd of pigs, along with a great number of his servants. â€œSo the demons begged Him, saying, "If You cast us out, permit us to go away into the herd of swine." However, He says to Peter, â€œBut I have prayed for you, that your faith should not failâ€? for Peter was in extreme danger due to his self-reliance. This shows that the devilâ€™s request for evil to be inflicted upon people is strong, but Jesusâ€™ request is far stronger when addressing the Father.

However, the disciples did not understand His purpose when He said, â€œlet him sell his garment and buy one. Therefore, they said, "Lord, look, here are two swords." And He said to them, "It is enough." He did not mean that two swords are enough but that it is enough talking about this subject because He realized that they were unable to understand. He also said enough so that in the future they will be able to understand. Those who doubt ask, where would the disciples get swords? St. John replies that these were the knives prepared for the Pascha and when the disciples realized the danger that our Lord was in, they took the knives to protect Him. Others have said that the people of Galilee used to wear swords at the time because the country was full of beasts and thieves, hence the disciples wore swords.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            ÙˆÙ‚ÙˆÙ„Ù‡ "ÙˆØ£Ø­ØµÙŠ Ù…Ø¹ Ø£Ø«Ù…Ø©" ÙŠØ±ÙŠØ¯ Ù…Ø¹ Ø§Ù„Ù„ØµÙˆØµ.
