On the night of the Lordâ€™s crucifixion He explained to the disciples the reason behind His crucifixion," the ruler of this world is coming, and he has nothing in Me. But that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father gave Me commandment, so I do.â€? Why is Satan named â€œruler of this worldâ€? and who made him its ruler? Adam did.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            "ÙˆØ£Ù…Ø§ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø¹Ø²ÙŠ Ø§Ù„Ø±ÙˆØ­ Ø§Ù„Ù‚Ø¯Ø³ Ø§Ù„Ø°ÙŠ Ø³ÙŠØ±Ø³Ù„Ù‡ Ø§Ù„Ø¢Ø¨ Ø¨Ø¥Ø³Ù…ÙŠ Ù?Ù‡Ùˆ ÙŠØ¹Ù„Ù…ÙƒÙ… ÙƒÙ„ Ø´ÙŠØ¡ ÙˆÙŠØ°ÙƒØ±ÙƒÙ… Ø¨ÙƒÙ„ Ù…Ø§ Ù‚Ù„ØªÙ‡ Ù„ÙƒÙ…" ÙˆÙ?ÙŠ ØªØ¹Ù„ÙŠÙ… Ø§Ù„Ø³ÙŠØ¯ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø³ÙŠØ­ Ù„ØªÙ„Ø§Ù…ÙŠØ°Ù‡ Ù„ÙŠÙ„Ø© ØµÙ„Ø¨Ø© Ø£Ø¸Ù‡Ø± Ù„Ù‡Ù… Ø³Ø¨Ø¨ ØµÙ„Ø¨Ù‡ Ø¹Ù†Ø¯Ù…Ø§ Ù‚Ø§Ù„ Ù„Ù‡Ù…: "Ù„Ø£Ù† Ø±Ø¦ÙŠØ³ Ù‡Ø°Ø§ Ø§Ù„Ø¹Ø§Ù„Ù… ÙŠØ£ØªÙŠ ÙˆÙ„ÙŠØ³ Ù„Ù‡ Ù?ÙŠ Ø´ÙŠØ¡ØŒ ÙˆÙ„ÙƒÙ† Ù„ÙŠÙ?Ù‡Ù… Ø§Ù„Ø¹Ø§Ù„Ù… Ø£Ù†ÙŠ Ø£Ø­Ø¨ Ø§Ù„Ø¢Ø¨ ÙˆÙƒÙ…Ø§ Ø£ÙˆØµØ§Ù†ÙŠ Ø§Ù„Ø¢Ø¨ Ù‡ÙƒØ°Ø§ Ø£Ù?Ø¹Ù„" ÙˆÙ„Ù…Ø§Ø°Ø§ ÙŠØ³Ù…Ù‰ Ø¥Ø¨Ù„ÙŠØ³ Ø±Ø¦ÙŠØ³ Ø§Ù„Ø¹Ø§Ù„Ù… ÙˆÙ…Ù† Ø§Ù„Ø°ÙŠ Ù‚Ù„Ø¯Ù‡ Ø§Ù„Ø±Ø¦Ø§Ø³Ø©ØŸ Ø¢Ø¯Ù… Ù‡Ùˆ Ø§Ù„Ø°ÙŠ Ø¬Ø¹Ù„Ù‡ Ø±Ø¦ÙŠØ³Ø§Ù‹.         </Language>      </Text>      <Text>         <Language id="English">            God created Adam free and gave him dominion over the beasts of the earth and the fowl of the air but when he obeyed Satan and sold himself to him by obeying his vile advice, he became a slave to Satan. All those born to Adam fell under the rule of Satan until Jesus came and set Adam and his offspring free from their bitter bondage. He died on the cross to save Adam, who has died as a punishment for his disobedience to Godâ€™s Commandments... Adam enslaved himself to Satan and Jesusâ€™ death delivered him from this slavery and captivity.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            ÙˆØ°Ù„Ùƒ Ø£Ù† Ø§Ù„Ù„Ù‡ ØªØ¹Ø§Ù„Ù‰ Ø®Ù„Ù‚ Ø¢Ø¯Ù… Ø­Ø±Ø§Ù‹ Ù…Ø³Ù„Ø·Ø§Ù‹ Ø¹Ù„Ù‰ Ø¬Ù…ÙŠØ¹ ÙˆØ­ÙˆØ´ Ø§Ù„Ø£Ø±Ø¶ ÙˆØ·ÙŠØ± Ø§Ù„Ø³Ù…Ø§Ø¡ ÙˆÙ„ÙƒÙ†Ù‡ Ù„Ù…Ø§ Ø£Ø·Ø§Ø¹ Ø¥Ø¨Ù„ÙŠØ³ ÙˆØ¨Ø§Ø¹ Ù†Ù?Ø³Ù‡ Ù„Ù‡ Ø¨Ø·Ø§Ø¹ØªÙ‡ Ù„Ù…Ø´ÙˆØ±ØªÙ‡ Ø§Ù„Ø±Ø¯ÙŠØ¦Ø©ØŒ Ø£ØµØ¨Ø­ Ø¹Ø¨Ø¯Ø§Ù‹ Ù„Ø¥Ø¨Ù„ÙŠØ³.

Jesus took hold of Satan and demanded the souls of Adam and his offspring in return for His death. That is why He said, â€œthe ruler of this world is coming, and he has nothing in Me.â€? Based on this, anyone who believes in Jesus is saved. Jesus said that He is the vine and the believers are the branches. He commanded that they remain firm in Him by loving Him and keeping His commandments so that they may be as fruitful as a firm, living branch in the vine. And just like a dead branch dries up, breaks off and is burnt, so will all those who do not believe in Him and are not firm in Him burn in the flames of Hell.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            ÙˆØ°Ù„Ùƒ Ø£Ù†Ù‡ Ù„Ù‡ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø¬Ø¯ Ù„Ù…Ø§ Ø¹Ù„Ù‚ Ø¹Ù„Ù‰ Ø®Ø´Ø¨Ø© Ø§Ù„ØµÙ„ÙŠØ¨ ÙˆÙ?Ø§Ø±Ù‚Øª Ù†Ù?Ø³Ù‡ Ø¬Ø³Ø¯Ù‡ Ø£Ø±Ø§Ø¯ Ø¥Ø¨Ù„ÙŠØ³ Ø£Ù† ÙŠÙ‚Ø¨Ø¶ Ø¹Ù„ÙŠÙ‡Ø§ ÙƒÙ…Ø§ ÙƒØ§Ù† ÙŠÙ?Ø¹Ù„ Ø¨Ù†Ø³Ù„ Ø¢Ø¯Ù… Ø­ØªÙ‰ Ù…Ø¬ÙŠØ¡ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø³ÙŠØ­.
