He started to brag in front of God of his wile by which he had managed to make Adam fall. He thought that God would not have the provision to save Adam and to restore him to his former glory. The great, wise Creator provided a way for Adamâ€™s deliverance and restoration. Just as the devil hid himself in a serpent to destroy Adam, God hid in man to hide His divinity from Satan, deliver Adam from Satanâ€™s control, and grant him eternal life. God trapped the devil in the net, which he had cast for Adam.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            Ø£Ù† Ø§Ù„Ø­ÙƒÙŠÙ… Ù?ÙŠ Ø§Ù„Ø´Ø± Ù„Ù…Ø§ Ø­Ø³Ø¯ Ø¢Ø¯Ù… Ø¹Ù„Ù‰ Ø§Ù„Ø±Ø¦Ø§Ø³Ø© ÙˆØ§Ù„Ù…Ø¬Ø¯ Ø§Ù„Ù„Ø°ÙŠÙ† Ø£Ø¹Ø·Ø§Ù‡Ù…Ø§ Ø§Ù„Ù„Ù‡ Ù„Ù‡ Ù?ÙŠ Ø§Ù„Ù?Ø±Ø¯ÙˆØ³.

He charmed people with sin and the earth became full of corruption. Satan took the soul of every dying man to Hades because they were under his control. This situation lasted five thousand and five hundred years until our God was incarnate and born of a woman. The devil thought that He was another naÃ¯ve individual under his control. The Lord played upon this misunderstanding and combined all His miraculous deeds with a display of human weakness like an entreat or a request of God to hide His divinity from Satan who feared Him.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            ÙˆÙ„Ù…Ø§ ÙƒØ§Ù† Ø§Ù„Ø´ÙŠØ·Ø§Ù† Ù…Ø³ØªÙˆÙ„ÙŠØ§Ù‹ Ø¹Ù„Ù‰ Ø§Ù„Ø¬Ù†Ø³ Ø§Ù„Ø¨Ø´Ø±ÙŠ.

The devil was unable to move because the divine rays surrounded him from all six directions. He then saw all the heavenly authorities restless around the cross and learnt with certainty that He is the Son of God. He remained under siege in the air where he could see all his doings concerning urging the Jews to boldly resent, fight and persecute Jesus. When all of this was revealed, he realized Godâ€™s patience with him and knew what he had reaped. He realized the worth of Jesusâ€™ ransom. He said nothing in the heavens or on earth could be worth one minute of Jesus standing in front of Pilate for a second let alone what happened before and after the judgment. God then reduced the heat on him to make him pay the ransom willingly. When he no longer felt the heat, he stood before the Master in humiliation begging for mercy and to remain in his base on earth. He asked that God accept all the souls that were in his power as ransom. God accepted the ransom and delivered Adam and his virtuous offspring from hell and restored him to his first position.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            ÙˆÙ„Ù…Ø§ Ø±Ø£Ù‰ Ø§Ù„Ø´ÙŠØ·Ø§Ù† Ø§Ù„Ø±Ø¨ ÙˆÙ‚Ø¯ "Ù†ÙƒÙ‘ÙŽØ³ Ø±Ø£Ø³Ù‡ ÙˆØ£Ø³Ù„Ù… Ø§Ù„Ø±ÙˆØ­ "Ø§Ø¨ØªÙ‡Ø¬ ÙˆØ³Ù?Ø± ÙˆØªÙ‚Ø¯ÙŽÙ… Ø¥Ù„ÙŠÙ‡ Ø¨Ù?Ø±Ø­ Ù…Ù?Ø±Ø· Ù„ÙŠÙ‚Ø¨Ø¶ Ø¹Ù„Ù‰ Ù†Ù?Ø³Ù‡ Ù„Ø£Ù†Ù‡ Ø¸Ù†Ù‡ Ø¥Ù†Ø³Ø§Ù†Ø§Ù‹ Ø³Ø§Ø°Ø¬Ø§Ù‹ Ø¶Ø¹ÙŠÙ?Ø§Ù‹.
