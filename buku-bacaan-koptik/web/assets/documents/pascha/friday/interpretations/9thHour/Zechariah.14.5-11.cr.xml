The incarnation helped them know Him and fully rejoice. He said to His disciples, â€œGo therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit:â€? and the world came to know the Trinity. His saying, â€œand his name oneâ€? refers to Jesus as one because of the union of the divine logos with the body that He had taken from the virgin Mary with a reasoning, speaking soul without mingling or confusion and He became one God and one Christ. St. Paul says, â€œthat at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, of those on earth, and of those under the earth;â€? because He is the One God, â€œFor in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily;â€? And of what He says to the disciples indicating His divinity and oneness, â€œDo you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? The words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwells in Me, He does the works. â€œBelieve Me that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me: or else believe Me for sake of the works themselves.â€? And his saying of the Holy Spirit, â€œHe will take of what is Mine and declare it to youâ€? He also told His disciples, â€œAnd these signs shall follow them that believe; In My name shall they cast out devilsâ€? He also said, â€œIf you shall ask any thing in My name, I will do it.â€?         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            Ù‚Ø§Ù„: "ÙˆÙ?Ù‰ Ø°Ù„Ùƒ Ø§Ù„ÙŠÙˆÙ… ÙŠÙƒÙˆÙ† Ø§Ù„Ø±Ø¨ ÙˆØ§Ø­Ø¯Ø§Ù‹ ÙˆØ§Ø³Ù…Ù‡ ÙˆØ§Ø­Ø¯Ø§Ù‹" ÙŠØ¹Ù†ÙŠ Ø¨Ù‡Ø°Ø§ Ø£Ù†Ù‡ Ù‚Ø¨Ù„ Ù…Ø¬ÙŠØ¡ Ø³ÙŠØ¯Ù†Ø§ ÙŠØ³ÙˆØ¹ Ø¥Ù„Ù‰ Ø§Ù„Ø¹Ø§Ù„Ù… Ù„Ù… ÙŠÙƒÙ† Ø£Ø­Ø¯ ÙŠØ¹Ø±Ù?
