Satan was one of the principalities of heaven but when he overstepped his boundaries and rejected the truth, he fell from his leadership position and from heaven to earth where he thought he would have no master. Hence, God created Adam to punish him, and made Adam ruler of the earth and what is upon it. When Satan witnessed this, he became jealous and envied manâ€™s leadership and the pleasures of paradise. He realized that, with the will of God, Adam would reach the heavenly status that he and his demons will not be able to achieve. Therefore, he trapped Adam and made him to fall. Adam was no longer the ruler of the earth but fell under Satanâ€™s leadership. The devil entered into the serpent and spoke to Eve, so she sinned, and so did her husband. And both lost their roles as rulers of the earth and became, along with their offspring, subservient to Satan. Satan now boasts of his evil council and claims victory over the Lord.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            Ø¥Ù† Ø§Ù„Ù„Ù‡ ØªØ¹Ø§Ù„Ù‰ Ù‚Ø¯ Ø®Ù„Ù‚ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ù„Ø§Ø¦ÙƒØ© ÙˆØ§Ù„Ø±Ø¤Ø³Ø§Ø¡ Ù?ÙŠ Ø§Ù„Ø³Ù…Ø§Ø¡ Ù„Ù„ØªØ³Ø¨ÙŠØ­ ÙˆØ§Ù„ØªÙ‚Ø¯ÙŠØ³ ÙˆÙ„Ù†Ù?Ø§Ø° Ù…Ø´ÙŠØ¦ØªÙ‡ ÙˆÙƒØ§Ù† Ø¥Ø¨Ù„ÙŠØ³ Ø£Ø­Ø¯ Ø§Ù„Ø±Ø¤Ø³Ø§Ø¡ Ø§Ù„ÙƒØ¨Ø§Ø± Ù?ÙŠ Ø§Ù„Ø³Ù…Ø§Ø¡ØŒ ÙˆÙ„ÙƒÙ†Ù‡ Ù„Ù…Ø§ ØªØ¹Ø¯Ù‰ Ø·ÙˆØ±Ù‡ØŒ ÙˆÙ…Ø§Ù„ Ø¨Ø¥Ø«Ø§Ø±Ù‡ Ø¹Ù† Ø§Ù„Ø­Ù‚ØŒ ÙˆØªØ¹Ø¸Ù… Ø¹Ù„Ù‰ Ø¨Ø§Ø±ÙŠÙ‡ØŒ ÙˆØ®Ø±Ø¬ Ø¹Ù† Ø§Ù„Ø­Ø¯ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø±Ø³ÙˆÙ… Ù„Ù‡.

He therefore delivered him by the greatest mystery of all when He delivered His only Son to die on the cross and save Adam judiciously. Pride and vanity brought the devil down to earth whereas the love and humbleness brought the Son of God to our world where He dwelled among us. When the devil saw Adam as ruler, he was cruel to him; whereas when the Son of God saw Adam in captivity and disgrace, He had mercy on him and sacrificed Himself for him.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            ÙˆÙ„Ù…Ø§ ÙƒØ§Ù† Ø¹Ø¯Ù„ Ø§Ù„Ù„Ù‡ ÙŠÙ‚ØªØ¶ÙŠ Ø¨Ø£Ù† Ù„Ø§ ÙŠØ®Ù„Øµ Ø¢Ø¯Ù… ÙˆÙ†Ø³Ù„Ù‡ Ù…Ù† Ø£Ø³Ø± Ø¥Ø¨Ù„ÙŠØ³ Ø§ØºØªØµØ§Ø¨Ø§Ù‹.

God conquered Satanâ€™s evil council with His mercy, humility and His acceptance of pain. Godâ€™s plan was to deliver man using good wisdom rather than Satanâ€™s evil council. When Jesus hid His divinity from Satan, Satan thought Jesus was a man, and made others kill Him. Jesus then asked Satan for the price of His death and in return freed the entire human race from his grasp.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            Ø§Ù„Ø´ÙŠØ·Ø§Ù† Ø§Ø³ØªØªØ± Ù?ÙŠ Ø¬Ø³Ù… Ø§Ù„Ø­ÙŠØ© Ø­ØªÙ‰ Ø£Ø·ØºÙ‰ Ø¢Ø¯Ù… ÙˆØ£Ø³Ø±Ù‡ ÙˆØ¬Ù…ÙŠØ¹ Ù†Ø³Ù„Ù‡ ÙˆØ§Ø¨Ù† Ø§Ù„Ù„Ù‡ Ø§Ø³ØªØªØ± Ù?ÙŠ Ø¬Ø³Ù… Ø¢Ø¯Ù… ÙˆØ£Ø®Ù?Ù‰ Ø³Ø± Ù„Ø§Ù‡ÙˆØªÙ‡ Ø¹Ù† Ø§Ù„Ø´ÙŠØ·Ø§Ù† Ø­ØªÙ‰ Ø®Ù„Øµ Ø§Ù„Ù†Ø§Ø³ Ø£Ø¬Ù…Ø¹ Ù…Ù† Ø£Ø³Ø±Ù‡.

When He gave the disciples His Holy body and Blood and told them that His blood will be shed to save the world, Satan could see His divinity especially after the long speech He gave to the disciples. In this speech, He showed them His divinity and that He is a true God from a true God equal to the Father in principle and that He is in the Father and the Father is in Him and that He is one with the Father and the Holy Spirit. He promised that He would send them a Comforter who would teach them everything. He then spoke to the Father, again clearly showing His divinity. Thus, when the devil was assured of His divinity and that He had taken human form to deliver the human race from his captivity, He sped to destroy His work by enticing the Jews to kill Him.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            ÙˆÙ†Ø¹Ù„Ù… Ù…Ù† Ø§Ù„Ø£Ù†Ø§Ø¬ÙŠÙ„ ÙƒÙŠÙ?

The weakness that our Lord showed was that, â€œHe began to be sorrowful and deeply distressed,â€? and â€œThen He said to them, "My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here and watch with Me. He blamed them when He returned and found them asleep, and said to them, â€œWatch and pray, lest you enter into temptation.â€?

In His prayer, the Lord said, â€œMy soul is exceedingly sorrowful.â€? As He desired to hide His divinity from the devil, He was truly sad because as He said, â€œthere will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents,â€? there is also a lot of sadness in heaven when a believer sins.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            ÙˆÙ‚Ø¯ Ø§Ù…ØªØ§Ø² Ù„ÙˆÙ‚Ø§ Ø¨Ø¥ÙŠØ±Ø§Ø¯ Ù‡Ø°Ø§ Ø§Ù„Ø®Ø¨Ø± ÙˆÙ„Ø§ ÙŠØ®Ù?ÙŠ Ø£Ù†Ù‡ ÙƒØ§Ù† Ø·Ø¨ÙŠØ¨Ø§Ù‹.

As human, He had no wish to die and as a human, He suffered and died. As God, His divinity does not suffer pain or death. His divine and human natures are one. As human, He suffered for us, Christians; but as God He is not subject to pain. When He told His disciples, â€œRise and pray, lest you enter into temptation,â€? He taught us to ask God to spare us trials of evil and not to rely upon ourselves. â€œThe spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak," which means that if your spirit is capable of handling trials, your body is weak.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            ÙˆÙ‚Ø¯ ÙƒØ§Ù† Ù?ÙŠ Ù‚ÙˆÙ„Ù‡ Ø§Ù„ØµØ¯Ù‚ Ø¹Ù†Ø¯Ù…Ø§ Ø³Ø£Ù„ Ø£Ù† ØªØ¹Ø¨Ø± Ø¹Ù†Ù‡ ÙƒØ£Ø³ Ø§Ù„Ù…ÙˆØª.
