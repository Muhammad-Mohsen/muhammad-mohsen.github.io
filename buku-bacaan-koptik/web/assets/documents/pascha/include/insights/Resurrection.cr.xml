(MtÂ 28:2). The guards shook with fear, trembling, and alarmed, becoming as dead men, from the awe of the angel.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            Ø¥Ù† Ù…Ø®Ù„ØµÙ†Ø§ Ù„Ù‡ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø¬Ø¯ Ù‚Ø¯ Ù‚Ø§Ù… Ù…Ù† Ø¨ÙŠÙ† Ø§Ù„Ø£Ù…ÙˆØ§Øª Ù?ÙŠ Ù?Ø¬Ø± Ø§Ù„ÙŠÙˆÙ… Ø§Ù„Ø£ÙˆÙ„ Ù…Ù† Ø§Ù„Ø¥Ø³Ø¨ÙˆØ¹.

(MkÂ 16:3). When they reached the tomb, â€œthey saw that the stone had been rolled awayâ€? (MkÂ 16:4), and that the Lord had risen. They were shocked, not knowing anything about the resurrection, about the guards who were sent on Friday to guard the tomb after they had left, or about the seal on the tomb. When they entered the tomb and did not find the body of the Lord, they were greatly perplexed.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            ÙˆÙ„Ù…Ø§ ÙƒØ§Ù† Ù?Ø¬Ø± Ø°Ù„Ùƒ Ø§Ù„ÙŠÙˆÙ… Ù‚Ø¯ Ù„Ø§Ø­ØŒ Ø®Ø±Ø¬Øª Ø§Ù„Ù†Ø³Ø§Ø¡ Ø§Ù„Ù„ÙˆØ§ØªÙŠ ÙƒÙ?Ù†ÙŽ ÙŠØ®Ø¯Ù…Ù†Ù‡.

The rest of the women remained at the tomb to verify this occurrence. Promptly, two angels appeared to them and informed them that Jesus had risen from the dead; â€œHe is not hereâ€? (Lk 24:6), as they had assumed, and to relay this information to His disciples. They left the tomb quickly and ran speedily towards the city to tell the disciples the events concerning the two angels whom they saw while in the tomb. As they went, they met Jesus on the road, so they â€œheld Him by the feetâ€? (MtÂ 28:9). He commanded them to tell His disciples the news of His resurrection from the dead, and that they had seen Him on the road.

When John saw that the linen cloths, which had been on the body of the Lord, were arranged in one place, and that the handkerchief, which was on His holy head was set aside separately, he was convinced that the body was not taken from there, neither by violence, nor by the hands of friends. The Lord had risen on His own, as He had foretold them, because He has â€œpower to lay it down, andâ€¦ power to take it againâ€? (JnÂ 10:18). These two disciples returned to the city, â€œBut Mary stood outside by the tomb weeping, and as she wept she stooped down and looked into the tomb. And she saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lainâ€¦ she turned around and saw Jesusâ€? (JnÂ 20:11-14). He spoke with her and commanded her to inform His disciples (Cf.

Furthermore, leaving the tomb without permission subjected them to severe retribution.

Without a doubt, Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus did not convene with them. The members consulted until they reached an agreement to give the guard a large sum of moneyâ€”a sufficient bribe. It is no secret that a bribe blinds the hearts of the sighted. They had already bribed Iscariot and the false witnesses before the crucifixion. They were forced after the crucifixion to bribe the guards with even more, instructing and compelling them to say that the disciples had come at night and stolen Jesus Christ away while they slept, and to conceal the news of the appearance of the two angels. If the people found out of the appearance of angels, and all the resurrection events, they would definitely believe in the truth of Christâ€™s call, and realize the slanderous lies of the chief priests against the Savior.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            Ù?Ø¥Ø¬ØªÙ…Ø¹ Ø±Ø¤Ø³Ø§Ø¡ Ø§Ù„ÙƒÙ‡Ù†Ø© Ù…Ø¹ Ø§Ù„Ø´ÙŠÙˆØ® ÙˆÙƒØ§Ù† Ø°Ù„Ùƒ Ø¥Ø¬ØªÙ…Ø§Ø¹ Ù…Ø¬Ù…Ø¹ Ø§Ù„Ø³Ø¨Ø¹ÙŠÙ†ØŒ Ù„ÙƒÙ† Ù„ÙŠØ³ ÙƒÙ„ Ø£Ø¹Ø¶Ø§Ø¦Ù‡ Ø¨Ù„ Ø§Ù„Ù…ØªÙ?Ù‚ÙˆÙ† Ø¹Ù„ÙŠ Ù‚ØªÙ„ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø³ÙŠØ­.
