This valley bore many names; the part falling southwest of Jerusalem is called Rabbabba Valley; in the Holy Bible it is called Valley of Hinnom (Josh 15:8; Neh 11:30), Valley of the son of Hinnom (Josh 15:8, 18:16), and Valley of the sons of Hinnom (KJV 2 Kg 23:10). It is a valley descending from the Hebron Gate to Jobâ€™s Well, separating Mount Zion from the Mount of Corruption. The southeastern portion of this valley is called Tophet (Jer 7:31; 2 Kg 23:10), or the Valley of Slaughter (Jer 7:32; 19:6), a border separating Benjamin and Judah. Solomon built on the southern crevice overlooking Tophet, the high places for Moab (1 Kg 11:7). Ahaz (2 Kg 16:3; 2 Chr 28:3) and Manasseh (2 Chr 33:6) passed their children through the fire in this valley. Josiah stopped this worship by desecrating the valley and the high places with human bones and other unclean objects, breaking the sacred pillars, and cutting down the wooden images (2 Kg 23:10,13,14). It became a place where all of the cityâ€™s rubbish was thrown out, and into where the entire cityâ€™s cesspool poured. Looking at what defiled this valley: Molechâ€™s fire, and the fire used to burn the rubbish, the Jews took to calling it Gehinnom [Hades] (land of Hinnom), making it a general location for punishment, throwing the bodies of the two thieves there. Had Joseph not come forward, asking Pilate for the body of the Lord Jesus, He would have been thrown with the thieves, as the Jewish rulers intended.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            ÙŠØ³Ù…ÙŠ Ù‡Ø°Ø§ Ø§Ù„ÙˆØ§Ø¯ÙŠ Ø¨Ø¹Ø¯Ø© Ø£Ø³Ù…Ø§Ø¡ØŒ Ù…Ù†Ù‡Ø§ Ø§Ù„Ø¬Ø²Ø¡ Ø§Ù„ÙˆØ§Ù‚Ø¹ Ø¬Ù†ÙˆØ¨ ØºØ±Ø¨ÙŠ Ø£ÙˆØ±Ø´Ù„ÙŠÙ… ÙŠØ¯Ø¹ÙŠ "Ø¨ÙˆØ§Ø¯ÙŠ Ø±Ø¨Ø§Ø¨Ø©"ØŒ ÙˆÙŠØ³Ù…ÙŠ Ù?ÙŠ Ø§Ù„ÙƒØªØ§Ø¨ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ù‚Ø¯Ø³ "ÙˆØ§Ø¯ÙŠ Ù‡Ù†ÙˆÙ…" (ÙŠØ´ Ù¨:Ù¡Ù¥ )ØŒ (Ù†Ø­Ù£Ù :Ù¡Ù¡)ØŒ ÙˆÙˆØ§Ø¯ÙŠ Ø§Ø¨Ù† Ù‡Ù†ÙˆÙ… (ÙŠØ´Ù¨:Ù¡Ù¥ ØŒ Ù¡Ù¦:Ù¡Ù¨)ØŒ ÙˆÙˆØ§Ø¯ÙŠ Ø¨ÙŠ Ù‡Ù†ÙˆÙ… (2Ù…Ù„23 : 10)ØŒ ÙˆÙ‡Ùˆ ÙˆØ§Ø¯Ù?

Nicodemus supported Joseph in opposition to the ruling which the Jews passed against Jesus (Jn 7:50â€“52). They wrapped Him in pure linen which was only done by the rich, noble, and affluent. The linen was a long strip to be wrapped around the body several times. No doubt the spices were placed on the body, mingling with it, and then He was wrapped in the strip and placed in the tomb. As Almighty God previously appointed Joseph the carpenter to care for Jesus during His childhood, He now appointed another Joseph to bury Him.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            Ø£Ø®Ø° ÙŠÙˆØ³Ù?

It was not in the means of the Virgin Mary or the disciples to take the body, but Joseph, who was unknown at that time as a disciple, but as a rich noble man, took it with the greatest ease. Thus, Isaiahâ€™s prophecy was fulfilled: â€œAnd they made His grave with the wickedâ€”but with the rich at His deathâ€? (Is 53:9). Also, Nicodemus, who came to learn from Jesus three years earlier (Jn 3:2), appeared now accompanying Joseph and helped him in the preparations for burying the Savior. He was placed in a new tomb, in which no one had been placed before, because God had ordained that the One who would not see corruption would not be placed in a tomb with other corrupted bodies (Ps 16:10; Acts 2:31). How amazing are Godâ€™s care and economy!         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            ÙˆÙ‡Ù†Ø§ Ù†Ø±ÙŠ Ø£ÙŠØ¶Ø§Ù‹ Ø¹Ù†Ø§ÙŠØ© Ø§Ù„Ù„Ù‡ Ø§Ù„Ø¹Ø¸ÙŠÙ…Ø© Ù?Ø¥Ù†Ù‡ Ù„Ù… ÙŠÙƒÙ† Ù?ÙŠ ÙˆÙ?Ø³Ù?Ø¹Ù’ Ø§Ù„Ø³ÙŠØ¯Ø© Ù…Ø±ÙŠÙ… Ø§Ù„Ø¹Ø°Ø±Ø§Ø¡ ÙˆÙ„Ø§ Ø§Ù„ØªÙ„Ø§Ù…ÙŠØ° Ø£Ù† ÙŠØ£Ø®Ø°ÙˆØ§ Ø§Ù„Ø¬Ø³Ø¯ØŒ ÙˆÙ„ÙƒÙ† ÙŠÙˆØ³Ù?

Thus, the time in which the Lord slept in the tomb was about 36 hours: part of Friday, Saturday (all day and night), and part of Sunday when He rose early. This duration is considered three days and three nights; this is a principle in the Talmud, such that adding one hour to a day counts as another day, and adding a day to a year counts as another year. The same principle was applied in Book of Esther (Esth 4:15â€“16), and this applies even today in our government. Most governments count one day of the year, a full year. For example, if a child is born on the last day of the year, the whole year is counted for him. Therefore, it is valid to say that the Lord Christ stayed in the tomb for three days and three nights, otherwise the Jews would have objected to the Christians and challenged the veracity of Christ for not fulfilling His promise of rising on the morning of the third day, but they never presented such an objection.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            Ø£Ù† Ø¬Ø³Ø¯ Ø§Ù„Ø±Ø¨ Ù‚Ø¯ ÙˆÙ?Ø¶Ø¹ Ù?ÙŠ Ø§Ù„Ù‚Ø¨Ø± ÙŠÙˆÙ… Ø§Ù„Ø¬Ù…Ø¹Ø© Ù‚Ø¨Ù„ ØºØ±ÙˆØ¨ Ø§Ù„Ø´Ù…Ø³ØŒ ÙˆÙ‚Ø§Ù… Ù?ÙŠ ØµØ¨Ø§Ø­ Ø§Ù„Ø£Ø­Ø¯ Ø¨Ø§ÙƒØ±Ø§Ù‹ØŒ Ù?ØªÙƒÙˆÙ† Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø¯Ø© Ø§Ù„ØªÙŠ Ù†Ø§Ù…Ù‡Ø§ Ø§Ù„Ø³ÙŠØ¯ Ù?ÙŠ Ø§Ù„Ù‚Ø¨Ø± Ù†Ø­Ùˆ Ø³ØªÙ?

Thus, He had prepared for us severe punishment, painful torment, and an impenetrable barrier separating us from God. Through the death of the Master, to whom is due glory, He blotted out the writing against us, broke the middle barrier between us and God, removed the enmity, brought us closer to Him, and reconciled us through His cross, as the Apostle Paul says, â€œFor it pleased the Father that in Him all the fullness should dwell, and by Him to reconcile all things to Himself, by Him, whether things on earth or things in heaven, having made peace through the blood of His crossâ€? (ColÂ 1:19-20). The same apostle also says in his letter to the Ephesians, â€œFor He Himself is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of separation, having abolished in His flesh the enmity, that is, the law of commandments contained in ordinances, so as to create in Himself one new man from the two, thus making peace, and that He might reconcile them both to God in one body through the cross, thereby putting to death the enmity. And He came and preached peace to you who were afar off and to those who were nearâ€? (Eph 2:14-17). And also saying to the Romans, â€œFor if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His lifeâ€?

(GalÂ 3:10). Everyone broke the law, and therefore, everyone became accursed. When death by the cross was installed as a curse, God wanted to die on the cross to lift off the curse from upon us, and to send us the blessing. The Apostle Paul says, â€œChrist has redeemed us from this curse of the law, having become a curse for us (for it is written, â€˜Cursed is everyone who hangs on a treeâ€™), that the blessing of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faithâ€?
