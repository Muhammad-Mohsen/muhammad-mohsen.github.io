There is no mention in the Holy Bible that Jesus did anything on this day; He sought solitude and isolation from people on this day. He avoided the multitudes, just as the Passover lamb also rested before the day of its slaughter.      </Language>      <Language id="Arabic">         ØµØ±Ù?

This is why He told the Jews, â€œSee! Your house is left to you desolate; for I say to you, you shall see Me no more till you say, â€˜Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!â€™â€? (MtÂ 23:38â€“39). He is the true Lord of the temple, and had revealed this authority by telling those who sold doves, â€œâ€˜Take these things away! Do not make My Fatherâ€™s house a house of merchandise!â€™ Then His disciples remembered that it was written, â€˜Zeal for Your house has eaten Me upâ€™â€? (JnÂ 2:16â€“17). He again established this when He entered Jerusalem publicly in a great celebration [Hosanna Sunday] (Mt 21:1â€“17). Since He was outright rejected and shunned by the Jews and their leaders, He left them and the place. This was to showcase that, â€œthis house, the temple, which was built to honor the Lord and His name is only a place of worship in image and authority, and is not My house. I leave it to you desolateâ€?; this accords with what God had told Solomon: But if you or your sons at all turn from following Me, and do not keep My commandments and My statutes which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods and worship them, then I will cut off Israel from the land which I have given them; and this house which I have consecrated for My name I will cast out of My sight. Israel will be a proverb and a byword among all peoples. And as for this house, which is exalted, everyone who passes by it will be astonished and will hiss, and say, â€˜Why has the Lord done thus to this land and to this house?â€™ Then they will answer, â€˜Because they forsook the Lord their God, who brought their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and have embraced other gods, and worshiped them and served them; therefore the Lord has brought all this calamity on themâ€™ (1 KgÂ 9:6â€“9).         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            ØªØ±Ùƒ Ø§Ù„Ø³ÙŠØ¯ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø³ÙŠØ­ Ù„Ù‡ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø¬Ø¯ Ø§Ù„Ù‡ÙŠÙƒÙ„ Ø¹Ù†Ø¯ Ù…Ø³Ø§Ø¡ ÙŠÙˆÙ… Ø§Ù„Ø«Ù„Ø§Ø«Ø§Ø¡ ÙˆØ±Ø¬Ø¹ Ø¥Ù„Ù‰ Ø¨ÙŠØª Ø¹Ù†ÙŠØ§ ÙˆÙ?ÙŠ Ù†ÙŠØªÙ‡ Ø¹Ø¯Ù… Ø§Ù„Ø¹ÙˆØ¯Ø© Ø§Ù„ÙŠÙ‡ Ø§Ù„Ø¨ØªØ© ÙˆØ°Ù„Ùƒ Ø¨Ø¹Ø¯ Ø£Ù† Ù‚Ø§Ù„ Ù„Ù„ÙŠÙ‡ÙˆØ¯ "Ù‡ÙˆØ°Ø§ Ø¨ÙŠØªÙƒÙ… ÙŠØªØ±Ùƒ Ù„ÙƒÙ… Ø®Ø±Ø§Ø¨Ø§Ù‹.

(MtÂ 26:15). So they promised to give him 30 pieces of silver [the price of a slave], equivalent to 33 pennies. Judas sold his Master for this disgraceful value; He, who loved him, chose him as His disciple, and made him His treasurer. This happened to fulfill that which was spoken by the prophet: â€œâ€˜If it is agreeable to you, give me my wages; and if not, refrain.â€™ So they weighed out for my wages thirty pieces of silver. And the Lord said to me, â€˜Throw it to the potterâ€™â€”that princely price they set on me. So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them into the house of the Lord for the potterâ€?

And they said, â€œWhat is that to us? You see to it!â€? Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed, and went and hanged himself. But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, â€œIt is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the price of blood.â€? And they consulted together and bought with them the potterâ€™s field, to bury strangers in. Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day (MtÂ 27:4â€“8). What was spoken by David the Prophet was fulfilled in Judas: For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful have opened against me; they have spoken against me with a lying tongue. They have also surrounded me with words of hatred, and fought against me without a cause. In return for my love they are my accusersâ€¦ Set a wicked man over him, and let an accuser stand at his right hand. When he is judged, let him be found guilty, and let his prayer become sin. Let his days be few, and let another take his office. Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow. Let his children continually be vagabonds, and beg; let them seek their bread also from their desolate placesâ€¦ Let his posterity be cut off, and in the generation following let their name be blotted out. Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered before the Lord, and let not the sin of his mother be blotted outâ€¦ As he loved cursing, so let it come to him; as he did not delight in blessing, so let it be far from him. As he clothed himself with cursing as with his garment, so let it enter his body like water, and like oil into his bonesâ€¦ Let this be the Lordâ€™s reward to my accusers, and to those who speak evil against my person (PsÂ 109:2â€“20).         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            ÙˆØ¨Ø¹Ø¯ Ù…Ø§ Ø§Ø³Ù„Ù…Ù‡ Ù„Ù‡Ù… Ø±Ø£Ù‰ Ù†Ù?Ø³Ù‡ Ø£Ù†Ù‡ Ù‚Ø¯ Ø¯ÙŠÙ† Ù?Ù…Ø¶ÙŠ Ù„ÙˆÙ‚ØªÙ‡ ÙˆØ±Ø¯ Ù„Ù‡Ù… Ø§Ù„Ù?Ø¶Ø© Ø§Ù„ØªÙ‰ Ø£Ø®Ø°Ù‡Ø§ Ù…Ù†Ù‡Ù… Ø«Ù…Ù† Ø³ÙŠØ¯Ù‡ Ø§Ù„ÙƒØ±ÙŠÙ… Ù‚Ø§Ø¦Ù„Ø§ "Ù‚Ø¯ Ø£Ø®Ø·Ø£Øª Ø§Ø° Ø³Ù„Ù…Øª Ø¯Ù…Ø§Ù‹ Ø¨Ø±ÙŠØ¦Ø§Ù‹".

The response is that our omniscient omnipresent God preceded and revealed to His servants the prophets the life events of the Savior on earthâ€”beginning from the Annunciation of the Angel to the Virgin until His Ascension to heaven and the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the disciples. All who treated the Lord Christ, whether with good or evil deeds, did so freely, not by force or compulsion. Godâ€™s foreknowledge was not the cause of peopleâ€™s actions. All the prophecies concerning Judas, Judas fulfilled freely, and willfully accomplishedâ€”he was the author of his life choices, which he made without coercion. He had no intention of fulfilling the prophecies. Even if this had been his intention, he still would have perished, because people have a choice to do that which is good and to avoid evil. God does not wish to take vengeance on a killer because he committed murder, as he said to Cain, â€œWhoever kills Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfoldâ€? (GenÂ 4:15). If so, then how much more shall the one who delivers honorable innocent blood, a Lamb without blemish, due to greed for thirty pieces of silverâ€”a worldly profit? His punishment comes from Divine Justice for delivering his righteous Master.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            ÙŠØªØ¨Ø§Ø¯Ø± Ù„Ù„Ø°Ù‡Ù† Ø§Ù†Ù‡ Ø¥Ø°Ø§ ÙƒØ§Ù† Ù„Ø§Ø¨Ø¯ Ø£Ù† ÙŠØ³Ù„Ù… Ø§Ù„Ø³ÙŠØ¯ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø³ÙŠØ­ Ù„Ù„ÙŠÙ‡ÙˆØ¯ Ù„ÙŠØµÙ„Ø¨ØŒ ÙˆØ¥Ù† Ù„Ù… ÙŠÙƒÙ† Ø¨ÙŠÙ‡ÙˆØ°Ø§ ÙƒØ§Ù† Ø³ÙŠÙƒÙˆÙ† Ø¨ØºÙŠØ±Ù‡ØŒ ÙˆØ§Ù„Ù†ØµÙˆØµ Ø§Ù„Ø§Ù„Ù‡ÙŠØ© ØªØ´ÙŠØ± Ø§Ù„Ù‰ ÙƒÙ„ Ù…Ø§ ÙŠØ¹Ù…Ù„Ù‡ ÙŠÙ‡ÙˆØ°Ø§ Ù?Ù…Ø§ Ù‡Ùˆ Ø°Ù†Ø¨Ù‡ ÙˆÙ…Ø§ Ù‡Ù‰ Ø®Ø·ÙŠØªÙ‡ ÙˆÙ„Ù…Ø§Ø°Ø§ ÙŠÙ‡Ù„ÙƒØŒ Ø§Ù„Ø¬ÙˆØ§Ø¨ : Ø§Ù† Ø§Ù„Ù„Ù‡ Ù„Ù‡ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø¬Ø¯ Ø§Ù„Ø¹Ø§Ù„Ù… Ø¨ÙƒÙ„ Ø´Ø¦ Ù‚Ø¨Ù„ ÙƒÙˆÙ†Ù‡ Ø³Ø¨Ù‚ Ù?Ø£ÙˆØ­Ù‰ Ø¹Ù† Ø£Ù?ÙˆØ§Ù‡ Ø¹Ø¨ÙŠØ¯Ù‡ Ø§Ù„Ø§Ù†Ø¨ÙŠØ§Ø¡ ÙƒÙ„ Ø­ÙŠØ§Ø© Ø§Ù„Ù?Ø§Ø¯Ù‰ Ø¹Ù„Ù‰ Ø§Ù„Ø§Ø±Ø¶ØŒ ÙˆØ°Ù„Ùƒ Ù…Ù† Ø¨Ø¯Ø¡ Ø¨Ø´Ø§Ø±Ø© Ø§Ù„Ù…Ù„Ø§Ùƒ Ù„Ù„Ø³ÙŠØ¯Ø© Ø§Ù„Ø¹Ø°Ø±Ø§Ø¡ Ø§Ù„Ù‰ Ø§Ù„ÙŠÙˆÙ… Ø§Ù„Ø°Ù‰ Ø¥Ø±ØªÙ?Ø¹ Ù?ÙŠÙ‡ Ø§Ù„ÙŠ Ø§Ù„Ø³Ù…Ø§Ø¡ØŒ ÙˆØ£Ø±Ø³Ù„ Ø§Ù„Ø±ÙˆØ­ Ø§Ù„Ù‚Ø¯Ø³ Ø¹Ù„Ù‰ Ø§Ù„ØªÙ„Ø§Ù…ÙŠØ°.

They pursue high profits by any means, defrauding by various ways until they fulfill their self-interest. They cheat, they lie, they flatter, they live without conscience, they become imposters, and they deceive innocent souls. They break the day of the Lord for the sake of a little money, the â€œroot of all kinds of evil, for which some have strayed from the faith in their greediness, and pierced themselves through with many sorrowsâ€? (1 TimÂ 6:10). May God guard and protect us from this evil and keep us faithful until death.

The response is that their actions were provoked by the devil (the enemy of humanity), and were done through personal desireâ€”meanwhile, their consciences bore witness to the Lord Christ. God will judge them for submitting to their desires; the judgment is just, whether passed on them or on others. It was not the Lord who asked them to crucify Him, or to fulfill the inevitable, but rather it was done of their own free will.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            ÙˆØ¥Ù† Ù‚Ø§Ù„ Ø§Ù„Ø¨Ø¹Ø¶ Ø¥Ù†Ù‡ ÙƒØ§Ù† Ø­ØªÙ…Ø§Ù‹ Ø£Ù† ÙŠØªÙ… Ø¨Ø§Ù„Ø³ÙŠØ¯ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø³ÙŠØ­ Ø¹Ù†Ø¯ Ù…Ø¬ÙŠØ¦Ù‡ Ø§Ù„Ù‰ Ø§Ù„Ø¹Ø§Ù„Ù… Ù…Ø§ ÙŠØªÙ…ØŒ ÙˆØ¥Ù†Ù‡ Ù„Ø§Ø¨Ø¯ Ø£Ù† ÙŠÙƒÙˆÙ† Ø¨ØºÙŠØ±Ù‡Ù…ØŒ Ù?Ù„Ù…Ø§Ø°Ø§ ÙŠØ¯ÙŠÙ† Ø§Ù„Ù„Ù‡ Ù‡Ø¤Ù„Ø§Ø¡ØŸ Ù„Ø£Ù† Ù…Ø§ Ù?Ø¹Ù„Ù‡ Ù‡Ø¤Ù„Ø§Ø¡ ÙƒØ§Ù† Ø¨Ø¥ÙŠØ¹Ø§Ø² Ù…Ù† Ø¥Ø¨Ù„ÙŠØ³ Ø¹Ø¯Ùˆ Ø§Ù„Ø¥Ù†Ø³Ø§Ù†ÙŠØ©ØŒ ÙˆÙ‚Ø¯ Ù?Ø¹Ù„ÙˆØ§ Ø°Ù„Ùƒ Ø¥Ø¨ØªØºØ§Ø¡ Ù„Ù†ÙˆØ§Ù„ Ø´Ù‡ÙˆØ§Øª Ø¨ÙŠÙ†Ù…Ø§ ÙƒØ§Ù†Øª Ø¶Ù…Ø§Ø¦Ø±Ù‡Ù… ØªØ´Ù‡Ø¯ Ù„Ù„Ø³ÙŠØ¯ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø³ÙŠØ­ØŒ Ù?Ø³ÙŠØ¯ÙŠÙ†Ù‡Ù… Ø§Ù„Ù„Ù‡ Ø¹Ù„Ù‰ Ø¥Ø³ØªØ³Ù„Ø§Ù…Ù‡Ù… Ù„Ø´Ù‡ÙˆØ§Øª Ù†Ù?ÙˆØ³Ù‡Ù…ØŒ Ù„Ø£Ù†Ù‡Ù… Ø¹Ù…Ù„ÙˆØ§ Ø£Ù?Ø¹Ø§Ù„Ù‡Ù… Ø¥Ø³ØªØ³Ù„Ø§Ù…Ø§Ù‹ Ù„Ø´Ù‡ÙˆØ§ØªÙ‡Ù… ÙˆÙ„ÙŠØ³ Ø¥ØªÙ…Ø§Ù…Ø§Ù‹ Ù„Ù„Ù†Ø¨ÙˆØ§ØªØŒ Ù?Ø¯ÙŠÙ†ÙˆÙ†ØªÙ‡Ù… Ø¹Ø§Ø¯Ù„Ø© Ø³ÙˆØ§Ø¡ ÙƒØ§Ù† Ù‡Ø¤Ù„Ø§Ø¡ Ø£Ù… ØºÙŠØ±Ù‡Ù… Ù?Ø¥Ù† Ø§Ù„Ø±Ø¨ Ù„Ù… ÙŠØ·Ù„Ø¨ Ù…Ù†Ù‡Ù… Ø£Ù† ÙŠØµÙ„Ø¨ÙˆÙ‡ Ø£Ùˆ Ø£Ù† ÙŠØªÙ…Ù…ÙˆØ§ Ù…Ø§ Ù„Ø§Ø¨Ø¯ Ø£Ù† ÙŠØªÙ… Ø¨Ù‡.         </Language>      </Text>   </Section></Document>
