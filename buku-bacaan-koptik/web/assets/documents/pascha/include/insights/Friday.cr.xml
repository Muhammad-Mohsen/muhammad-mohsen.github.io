Jn 18:1). This deep brook, also named the Black Brook, is located between Jerusalem and Mount Olivet. Its stream starts about one and a half miles northwest of Jerusalem and flows southeast until it reaches the northeastern corner of the city wall, at which point, it then streams east of the city. It claims the name Valley of Jehoshaphat (Cf. Joel 3:2) when the city wall is to its west, and Mount Olivet and the Hill of Disobedience are to its east; then, it stretches toward Mar Saba where it bears the name Monk Valley. From there, it extends to Lotâ€™s sea, where it bears the name Fire Creek; it is also known as Cedar (Cedron) Valley. After the obscene image of Maachah (Cf. 1 Kg 15:13; 2 Chr 15:16) was burned, and all the vain worship utensils which profaned the Lordâ€™s temple were cast into this brook (Cf. 2 Chr 29:16; 30:14; 2 Kg 23:4, 6, 12), this brook became a common cemetery (Cf. 2 Kg 23:6). David crossed this brook when he fled from his son Absalom (Cf. 2 Sam 15:23, 30); likewise, the Lord Christ while in Gethsemane (aware that Judas was familiar with this place) did not attempt to hide. Rather, He was prepared to offer Himself as a propitiation for the sins of the world, to the extent that He did not wait for the soldiers to inquire of Him. In anticipation, He went out to meet them, asking, â€œWhom are you seeking?â€? (Jn 18:4). This was at midnight on Friday, the 15th day of the month of Nisan.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            Ø¨Ø¹Ø¯ Ù…Ø§ Ø£ÙƒÙ„ Ù…Ø®Ù„ØµÙ†Ø§ -Ù„Ù‡ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø¬Ø¯- Ø§Ù„Ù?ØµØ­ Ù…Ø¹ ØªÙ„Ø§Ù…ÙŠØ°Ù‡ Ø¨Ø£ÙˆØ±Ø´Ù„ÙŠÙ…ØŒ Ø³Ø¨Ø­ÙˆØ§ ÙˆØ®Ø±Ø¬ÙˆØ§ Ø¥Ù„Ù‰ Ø¬Ø¨Ù„ Ø§Ù„Ø²ÙŠØªÙˆÙ† Ø§Ù„Ù‰ Ø¹Ø¨Ø± ÙˆØ§Ø¯Ù‰ Ù‚Ø¯Ø±ÙˆÙ† (ÙŠÙˆ 18: 1)ØŒ ÙˆÙƒØ§Ù† Ù‡Ø°Ø§ Ø§Ù„ÙˆØ§Ø¯Ù‰ Ø¹Ù…ÙŠÙ‚Ø§Ù‹ØŒ ÙˆÙŠØ³Ù…Ù‰ Ø¨Ø§Ù„ÙˆØ§Ø¯ÙŠ Ø§Ù„Ø§Ø³ÙˆØ¯.

But two of them (Peter and John) calmed their fears and followed the multitude to the court of the high priest, Annas (father-in-law of Caiaphas). Customarily, members of this council assembled in one of the temple quarters, but they were also permitted to meet at the high priestâ€™s court. Perhaps, the intended purpose of this meeting was to conceal their conspiracy from the multitude, especially since at that time, the temple quarters were overcrowded with people during the Passover.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            Ù„Ù…Ø§ Ù‚Ø¨Ø¶ Ø§Ù„Ø¬Ù†Ø¯ Ø¹Ù„Ù‰ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø®Ù„Øµ -Ù„Ù‡ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø¬Ø¯- ÙˆØ±Ø£Ù‰ Ø§Ù„ØªÙ„Ø§Ù…ÙŠØ° Ø£Ù† Ù…Ø¹Ù„Ù…Ù‡Ù… Ù‚Ø¯ Ø£Ù?ÙˆØ«Ù?Ù‚ÙŽ ÙˆØ£Ù?Ø®Ù?Ø°ÙŽ Ù?ØªØ±ÙƒÙˆÙ‡ ÙˆÙ‡Ø±Ø¨ÙˆØ§ØŒ ØºÙŠØ± Ø£Ù† Ø¥Ø«Ù†ÙŠÙ† Ù…Ù†Ù‡Ù… Ø³ÙŽÙƒÙ† Ø±ÙˆØ¹Ù‡Ù…Ø§ ÙˆÙ‡Ù…Ø§ Ø¨Ø·Ø±Ø³ ÙˆÙŠÙˆØ­Ù†Ø§ Ø§Ù„Ù„Ø°Ø§Ù† ØªØ¨Ø¹Ø§ Ø§Ù„Ø¬Ù…Ø¹ Ø¥Ù„Ù‰ Ø¯Ø§Ø± Ø±Ø¦ÙŠØ³ Ø§Ù„ÙƒÙ‡Ù†Ø© "Ø­Ù†Ø§Ù†" Ø§Ù„Ø°Ù‰ ÙƒØ§Ù† Ø­Ù…Ø§ "Ù‚ÙŠØ§Ù?Ø§"ØŒ ÙˆÙƒØ§Ù† Ù…Ù† Ø¹Ø§Ø¯Ø© Ø£Ø¹Ø¶Ø§Ø¡ Ø°Ù„Ùƒ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø¬Ù„Ø³ Ø£Ù† ÙŠØ¬ØªÙ…Ø¹ÙˆØ§ Ù?Ù‰ Ø¥Ø­Ø¯Ù‰ Ø¯ÙŠØ§Ø±Ø§Øª Ø§Ù„Ù‡ÙŠÙƒÙ„ØŒ ÙˆÙƒØ§Ù† ÙŠØ¬ÙˆØ² Ù„Ù‡Ù… Ø§Ù„Ø¥Ø¬ØªÙ…Ø§Ø¹ Ù?Ù‰ Ø¯Ø§Ø± Ø±Ø¦ÙŠØ³ Ø§Ù„ÙƒÙ‡Ù†Ø©.

Thereafter, with the Roman conquest, the high priest was appointed and discharged according to the empireâ€™s fancy, irrespective of the lineage or qualification of the person.

When the Jews arrested the Lord Christ, they first took Him to Annas, to enlist his approval and endorsement of the arrest, and then, they took the Lord of glory bound to Caiaphas (Jn 18:24).         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            ÙˆÙ‡ÙƒØ°Ø§ Ø¬Ø±Ù‰ Ù…Ø¹ Ø­Ù†Ø§Ù† Ù?Ø¥Ù†Ù‡ Ø¯Ù?Ø¹Ù‰ Ø±Ø¦ÙŠØ³ Ø§Ù„ÙƒÙ‡Ù†Ø© Ù…Ø¹ Ø£Ù†Ù‡ ÙƒØ§Ù† Ù…Ø¹Ø²ÙˆÙ„Ø§Ù‹ Ù…Ù† ÙˆØ¸ÙŠÙ?ØªÙ‡ ÙˆÙ‚ØªØ¦Ø° [Ù‚Ø¨Ù„ Ø§Ù„ØµÙ„Ø¨ Ø¨Ø£Ø±Ø¨Ø¹Ø© Ø³Ù†ÙˆØ§Øª].

Being a member of the Sadducees sect, and Annasâ€™ son-in-law, he was also spuriously given the title of high priest (Jn 11:49). Caiaphas is the one who said, â€œIt is expedient for us that one man should die for the people, and not that the whole nation should perishâ€? (Jn 11:49â€“50). Just as the case with Annas, Caiaphas, too, was deposed as the high priest at the will of the Romans. He was deposed by Vitalious (or Valarius), Pontius Pilateâ€™s successor, as the Roman governor ruling Judea. This occurred six years after the Lord Christâ€™s crucifixion.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            "Ù‚ÙŠØ§Ù?Ø§" Ø¥Ø³Ù…Ù‡ "ÙŠÙˆØ³Ù?"

The ruling deliberated was the death of Jesus. This was considered merely an expression of the membersâ€™ opinions because it contradicted both Jewish law, which prohibits conducting an examination during the night, and also Roman law, which forbids passing a ruling before dawn. This reveals the intensity of the high priestsâ€™ wrath towards Jesus, and their dread of His impact on the people. The council met at night in order to fabricate an accusation for His death.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            Ù„Ù…Ø§ ÙƒØ§Ù† Ù†Ù‡Ø§Ø± ØµØ¨Ø§Ø­ ÙŠÙˆÙ… Ø§Ù„Ø¬Ù…Ø¹Ø© Ø¥Ø¬ØªÙ…Ø¹ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø¬Ù…Ø¹ Ø§Ù„ÙƒØ¨ÙŠØ± Ù?Ù‰ Ø§Ù„Ù‡ÙŠÙƒÙ„ ÙˆØ£Ø«Ø¨Øª Ø­ÙƒÙ… Ø§Ù„Ø¬Ù„Ø³Ø© Ø§Ù„Ø³Ø§Ø¨Ù‚Ø© Ø§Ù„ØºÙŠØ± Ø§Ù„Ø±Ø³Ù…ÙŠØ© ÙˆØ§Ù„ØªÙ‰ Ø¹Ù?Ù‚Ù?Ø¯Øª Ù?Ù‰ Ø§Ù„Ù„ÙŠÙ„ Ù?Ù‰ Ø¯Ø§Ø± Ø±Ø¦ÙŠØ³ Ø§Ù„ÙƒÙ‡Ù†Ø©ØŒ Ù„Ø£Ù† Ø§Ù„Ø­ÙƒÙ… Ø¹Ù„ÙŠ ÙŠØ³ÙˆØ¹ Ø¨Ø§Ù„Ù…ÙˆØª Ù?Ù‰ ØªÙ„Ùƒ Ø§Ù„Ø¬Ù„Ø³Ø© ÙƒØ§Ù† ÙŠÙ?Ø¹ØªØ¨Ø± ÙƒÙ…Ø¬Ø±Ø¯ ØªØµØ±ÙŠØ­ Ø¨Ø±Ø£Ù‰ Ø§Ù„Ø£Ø¹Ø¶Ø§Ø¡ØŒ Ù„Ø£Ù†Ù‡ ÙƒØ§Ù† Ù…Ø®Ø§Ù„Ù?Ø§Ù‹ Ù„Ø´Ø±ÙŠØ¹Ø© Ø§Ù„ÙŠÙ‡ÙˆØ¯ Ø£Ù† ÙŠÙ?Ø¬Ø±ÙŠ Ù?Ø­Øµ Ø¬Ù†Ø§ÙŠØ© Ù?Ù‰ Ø§Ù„Ù„ÙŠÙ„ØŒ ÙˆÙƒØ°Ù„Ùƒ Ù…Ø®Ø§Ù„Ù?Ø§Ù‹ Ù„Ù„Ø´Ø±ÙŠØ¹Ø© Ø§Ù„Ø±ÙˆÙ…Ø§Ù†ÙŠØ© Ø£Ù† ÙŠØµØ¯Ø± Ø­ÙƒÙ… Ù‚Ø¨Ù„ Ø§Ù„Ù?Ø¬Ø±.

He testified that Jesus was a blasphemer, and incited the council to concur with his ruling against Him. His entire emotional enactment was a hypocritical and deceptive attempt to promote his evil objective. He further added to his iniquity by tearing his clothes, because according to Mosaic Law, the chief priest was forbidden from tearing his clothes (Lev 10:6; 21:10).

They refrained from the latter, in fear that many from the crowd would come to defend Jesus and rescue Him. They resorted to ask Pilate to carry out their charge to kill Jesus. At that time, Roman law passed judgment of crucifixion in cases of blasphemy. This was the Lord of gloryâ€™s accusation, and thus, He was to die in the fleshâ€”crucified, and not stoned. These council members were in agreement on their judgment, yet in order to make it lawful, because according to their assembly by-laws it was forbidden to carry out nocturnal judgments against criminals, they had to meet again. Therefore, they met once more after the break of dawn and repeated the charge against Him (Mt 27:3) (this was the last time Jesus stood before the Jewish rulers).         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            ÙˆÙƒØ§Ù† Ù…Ù…ÙƒÙ†Ø§Ù‹ Ù„Ø£Ø¹Ø¶Ø§Ø¡ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø¬Ù„Ø³ Ø£Ù† ÙŠØ£Ù…Ø±ÙˆØ§ Ø§Ù„Ù†Ø§Ø³ Ø¨Ø±Ø¬Ù… ÙŠØ³ÙˆØ¹ Ø¹Ù„Ù‰ Ø±ØºÙ… Ø­ÙƒØ§Ù… Ø§Ù„Ø±ÙˆÙ…Ø§Ù†ØŒ ÙƒÙ…Ø§ Ù?Ø¹Ù„ÙˆØ§ Ø¨Ø¹Ø¯ Ø°Ù„Ùƒ Ø¨Ø§Ø³ØªÙ?Ø§Ù†ÙˆØ³ØŒ ÙˆØ£Ù† ÙŠØ³ØªØ£Ø°Ù†ÙˆØ§ Ø¨ÙŠÙ„Ø§Ø·Ø³ Ù?Ù‰ Ø°Ù„ÙƒØŒ ÙˆÙ„ÙƒÙ†Ù‡Ù… Ù„Ù… ÙŠÙ?Ø¹Ù„ÙˆØ§ Ù‡Ø°Ø§ Ø®ÙˆÙ?Ø§Ù‹ Ù…Ù† Ø£Ù† ÙƒØ«ÙŠØ±ÙŠÙ† Ù…Ù† Ø§Ù„Ø´Ø¹Ø¨ Ù‚Ø¯ ÙŠØ¯Ø§Ù?Ø¹ÙˆÙ† Ø¹Ù† ÙŠØ³ÙˆØ¹ ÙˆÙŠÙ†Ù‚Ø°ÙˆÙ†Ù‡ Ù…Ù† Ø£ÙŠØ¯ÙŠÙ‡Ù…ØŒ Ù?Ø¥Ø³ØªØ­Ø³Ù†ÙˆØ§ Ø£Ù† ÙŠØ³Ø£Ù„ÙˆØ§ Ø¨ÙŠÙ„Ø§Ø·Ø³ Ø£Ù† ÙŠÙ?Ø¬Ø±Ù‰ Ø­ÙƒÙ…Ù‡Ù… Ø£Ù‰ Ø£Ù† ÙŠÙ‚ØªÙ„Ù‡.

The intention of this session was to affirm the decision taken at the nocturnal meeting, which was contrary to regulations and deemed unlawful according to the Talmud (one of the holiest Jewish books). According to the standards set out in the Talmud, the counsel is prohibited from examining criminal cases at night, especially ones that carry the death penalty. It is necessary for the conviction of death to be passed at the time of trial, and no ruling was to be delivered without self-testimony. Since the counsel broke this fundamental law by trying Jesus at night, they found it necessary to rectify the situation by holding a formal lawful session early in the morning. This session was held in its formal location (in the temple), unlike the nocturnal session, which was held in the court of the high priest. The intended purpose was to question Jesus, and provoke Him to speak blasphemously, in order to procure Pilateâ€™s (the Roman governor) collaboration with their sentence. As all the evangelists recorded, they arrested Him and took Him to Pilate (Mt 27:11-30; Mk 15:6-20; Lk 23:13-32; Jn 19:6-7).         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            ÙˆÙ„Ù…Ø§ ÙƒØ§Ù† Ø§Ù„ØµØ¨Ø§Ø­ Ø£Ù‰ ØµØ¨Ø§Ø­ ÙŠÙˆÙ… Ø§Ù„Ø¬Ù…Ø¹Ø© ØªØ´Ø§ÙˆØ±ØŒ Ø¬Ù…ÙŠØ¹ Ø±Ø¤Ø³Ø§Ø¡ Ø§Ù„ÙƒÙ‡Ù†Ø© ÙˆØ´ÙŠÙˆØ® Ø§Ù„Ø´Ø¹Ø¨ Ø¹Ù„Ù‰ ÙŠØ³ÙˆØ¹ Ø­ØªÙ‰ ÙŠÙ‚ØªÙ„ÙˆÙ‡ØŒ ÙˆÙƒØ§Ù† Ø§Ù„ØºØ±Ø¶ Ù…Ù† Ø¥Ù†Ø¹Ù‚Ø§Ø¯ Ù‡Ø°Ù‡ Ø§Ù„Ø¬Ù„Ø³Ø© Ø¥Ø«Ø¨Ø§Øª Ù…Ø§ Ø­ÙƒÙ…ÙˆØ§ Ø¨Ù‡ Ù?Ù‰ Ø¥Ø¬ØªÙ…Ø§Ø¹Ù‡Ù… Ù?Ù‰ Ø§Ù„Ù„ÙŠÙ„.

His remorse, however, was not a true repentance; otherwise; he would have sought and attained forgiveness. True repentance leads the transgressor to Christ; yet, this remorse was not from a heart void of deceit. A true repentant heart leads to life, but false repentance leads to more transgression. We see this in the example of Judas, who furthered his betrayal by committing suicide. His remorse is likened to Cain and King Saulâ€™s, spiraling downward to hopelessness and despair. When Judasâ€™ conscience awoke, he felt the gravity of the crime he committed against his good Masterâ€”he had relinquished himself to the devil, who in turn, used him to fulfill his evil intentions and left him without consolation or hope. Furthermore, divine help forsook him, and so in despair, he went and hanged himself, adding to his transgressions.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            Ø­ÙŠÙ†Ø¦Ø° Ù„Ù…Ø§ Ø±Ø£ÙŠ ÙŠÙ‡ÙˆØ°Ø§ Ø£Ù†Ù‡ Ù‚Ø¯ Ø¯ÙŠÙ†ØŒ Ù†Ø¯Ù… ÙˆØ±Ø¯ Ø§Ù„Ø«Ù„Ø§Ø«ÙŠÙ† Ù…Ù† Ø§Ù„Ù?Ø¶Ø© (Ù…Øª 27: 3)ØŒ Ù?Ù†Ø¯Ù…Ù‡ Ù‡Ø°Ø§ Ù„Ù… ÙŠÙƒÙ† ØªÙˆØ¨Ø© Ø­Ù‚ÙŠÙ‚ÙŠØ© ÙˆØ¥Ù„Ø§ Ù„Ø­Ù…Ù„Ù‡ Ø¹Ù„Ù‰ Ø·Ù„Ø¨ Ø§Ù„Ù…ØºÙ?Ø±Ø© Ù?ÙŠÙ†Ø§Ù„Ù‡Ø§.

When Peter felt the gravity of his sin, he withdrew from people, sought isolation, and wept bitterly (Lk 22:62) (as the Holy Bible mentions). He did this because of his great shame and sorrow, and for his wrongdoings toward the Savior, and for his weakness, fearfulness, blaspheming of grace, and his transgression in denying Christ by cursing and swearing after boasting of his courage and steadfastness. Truth be told, his transgression was very great because he committed it after having spent three years as a disciple of Jesus: hearing His teachings, witnessing His miracles, seeing His signs, and being chosen over the others as one of the three distinguished disciples. He had dined with Him only a few hours earlier, heard His warning, and vowed saying, â€œIf I have to die with You, I will not deny You!â€? (Mk 14:31). The trials that set Peter to deny Christ were meager, as he was not threatened by great men, strong forces, or the most distinguished of people, but rather by a maidservant. Peter saw John, who â€œwas known to them as one of Christâ€™s disciplesâ€? (Jn 18:15â€“16). Therefore, it cannot be said that Peterâ€™s transgression is less than Judasâ€™. But unlike Judas, Peter offered a true repentance. His remorse was not akin to Judasâ€™ remorse because Judasâ€™ remorse was that of hopelessness, while Peterâ€™s remorse led him to seek true repentance. This was exemplified by his isolation, the extent of his remorse, and his regret. His repentance can be likened to Davidâ€™s repentance. The difference between a hypocrite and a Christian is that the first falls and does not rise, while the latter falls but rises remorsefully, penitently, humbly, and consequentially renewed in his spiritual life.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            Ù?ÙŠÙˆØ¬Ø¯ Ù?Ø±Ù‚ Ø¹Ø¸ÙŠÙ… Ù…Ø§ Ø¨ÙŠÙ† Ù†Ø¯Ø§Ù…Ø© ÙŠÙ‡ÙˆØ°Ø§ ÙˆÙ†Ø¯Ø§Ù…Ø© Ø¨Ø·Ø±Ø³ØŒ Ù?Ø¨Ø·Ø±Ø³ Ù„Ù…Ø§ Ø´Ø¹Ø± Ø¨Ø¹Ø¸Ù… Ø§Ù„Ø®Ø·Ø£ Ø§Ù„Ø°Ù‰ ÙˆÙ‚Ø¹ Ù?ÙŠÙ‡ Ø¥Ø¹ØªØ²Ù„ Ø§Ù„Ù†Ø§Ø³ ÙˆØ£Ø­Ø¨ Ø§Ù„Ø¥Ù†Ù?Ø±Ø§Ø¯ ÙˆØ¨ÙƒÙ‰ Ø¨ÙƒØ§Ø¡ Ù…Ø±Ø§Ù‹ (Ù„Ùˆ22: 62) ÙƒÙ…Ø§ ÙŠØ°ÙƒØ± Ø§Ù„ÙƒØªØ§Ø¨ØŒ Ù„Ø®Ø¬Ù„Ù‡ ÙˆØ£Ø³Ù?Ù‡ Ø§Ù„Ø´Ø¯ÙŠØ¯ÙŠÙ† Ø¹Ù„Ù‰ Ù…Ø§ Ù?Ø±Ø· Ù…Ù†Ù‡ Ù?Ù‰ Ø­Ù‚ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø®Ù„Øµ ÙˆØ¹Ù„Ù‰ Ù…Ø§ ÙƒØ§Ù† Ø¹Ù„ÙŠÙ‡ Ù…Ù† Ø¶Ø¹Ù?

The intent behind gathering the entire assembly and parading in the morning to Pilatesâ€™ court was to sway Pilate and convince him that the accusedâ€”Jesus, had committed the greatest, most despicable, repugnant crime. When Pilate was informed that the great council members had arrived with a transgressor, they sent Jesus to Pilate and stood at the doorway (they could not enter into the Praetorium because the law forbade them from entering a house where there is leaven). They did not enter lest they become unclean and be prohibited from eating the Passover. Knowing this, Pilate went out to meet them. They were eager to present their accuser, without mentioning the reasons for which the great assembly had condemned Him, in hopes to establish a hasty conviction. However, their hope was lost when Pilate asked, â€œWhat accusation do you bring against this Man?â€? (Jn 18:29). At this point, they were compelled to declare their fabricated accusation. After hearing this, Pilate declared that he found no reason for condemning Jesus to death (Lk 23:22,14,4; Jn 18:38, 19:6,4), which dampened their hopes of condemning Christ. St. Luke the Evangelist mentions that Pilate publicly confessed three times that he found no justifiable reason for our Saviorâ€™s death; he further confessed that Herod also found no reason (Lk 23:14-15).         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            ÙˆÙ„Ù…Ø§ Ø£Ù?Ø±Ø³Ù„ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø®Ù„Øµ Ù„Ù‡ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø¬Ø¯ Ù?Ù‰ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø±Ø© Ø§Ù„Ø£ÙˆÙ„Ù‰ Ø¥Ù„Ù‰ Ø§Ù„ÙˆØ§Ù„Ù‰ Ø§Ù„Ø±ÙˆÙ…Ø§Ù†Ù‰ ØµØ­Ø¨Ù‡ ÙƒÙ„ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø¬Ù…Ø¹ Ø§Ù„ÙƒØ¨ÙŠØ± (Ù…Øª 27: 1-2)ØŒ (Ù„Ùˆ23: 1)ØŒ ÙˆÙ„Ø§Ø¨Ø¯ Ø£Ù†Ù‡Ù… ÙƒØ§Ù†ÙˆØ§ ÙŠÙ‚ØµØ¯ÙˆÙ† Ù…Ù† ØªØ¬Ù…Ù‡Ø±Ù‡Ù… Ù‡Ø°Ø§ ÙˆØ§Ù„Ø°Ù‡Ø§Ø¨ Ø¨Ù…ÙˆÙƒØ¨ Ø­Ø§Ù?Ù„ Ù…Ù† Ø§Ø¯Ù†ÙŠØ§Ø¡ ÙˆÙƒØ¨Ø±Ø§Ø¡ Ø£Ù† ÙŠÙ…ÙˆÙ‡ÙˆØ§ Ø¹Ù„Ù‰ Ø¹Ù‚Ù„ Ø¨ÙŠÙ„Ø§Ø·Ø³ ÙˆÙŠÙ‚Ù†Ø¹ÙˆÙ‡ Ø¨Ø£Ù† ÙŠØ³ÙˆØ¹ Ù‚Ø¯ Ø¥Ø±ØªÙƒØ¨ Ø¬Ù†Ø§ÙŠØ© Ù…Ù† Ø£Ù?Ø¸Ø¹ ÙˆØ£Ø´Ù†Ø¹ Ø§Ù„Ø¬Ù†Ø§ÙŠØ§Øª Ø§Ù„ØªÙ‰ Ù„Ù… ÙŠÙ?Ø³Ù…Ø¹ Ø¨Ù…Ø«Ù„Ù‡Ø§ØŒ Ù…Ø¨Ø§Ù„ØºÙŠÙ† Ù?Ù‰ Ø¥Ø³ØªØ¯Ø§Ù†ØªÙ‡.

Archelaus, the son of Herod the Great, was the last king over Judea.(he was removed from ruling in the year 6 AD). From that time forward, Caesar appointed governors over Judea. Pilate was Tiberius Caesarâ€™s sixth appointed governor over Judea. He governed Judea for ten years (six before Christâ€™s crucifixion, and four after His Resurrection). He was known to be ruthless, unjust, temperamental, and sought only his personal gain; he did not care for the good of others. The Jews rebelled against his reign often. Consequently, he shed their blood readily to suffocate their insurrections, so much so that the Jews passionately despised him and complained to Caesar several times.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            Ø¨ÙŠÙ„Ø§Ø·Ø³ Ù‡Ø°Ø§ ÙƒØ§Ù† ÙŠÙ„Ù‚Ø¨ Ø¨Ø§Ù„Ø¨Ù†Ø·Ù‰ØŒ ÙƒØ§Ù† Ø£Ø±Ø®Ù„Ø§ÙˆØ³ Ø¨Ù† Ù‡ÙŠØ±ÙˆØ¯Ø³ Ø§Ù„ÙƒØ¨ÙŠØ± Ø¢Ø®Ø± Ù…Ù„Ùƒ Ø¹Ù„ÙŠ Ø§Ù„ÙŠÙ‡ÙˆØ¯ÙŠØ© ÙˆÙƒØ§Ù† Ù‚Ø¯ Ù†Ù?Ù‰ Ù…Ù† Ø­ÙƒÙ…Ù‡ Ø³Ù†Ø© Ø³Øª Ù„Ù„Ù…ÙŠÙ„Ø§Ø¯ØŒ ÙˆÙ…Ù† Ø°Ù„Ùƒ Ø§Ù„ÙˆÙ‚Øª Ø£Ø®Ø° Ù‚ÙŠØµØ± ÙŠÙ‚ÙŠÙ… Ø¹Ù„Ù‰ Ø§Ù„ÙŠÙ‡ÙˆØ¯ÙŠØ© Ø§Ù„ÙˆÙ„Ø§Ø©ØŒ Ù?ÙƒØ§Ù† Ø¨ÙŠÙ„Ø§Ø·Ø³ Ø³Ø§Ø¯Ø³ ÙˆØ§Ù„ÙŠ Ø¹Ù„Ù‰ Ø§Ù„ÙŠÙ‡ÙˆØ¯ÙŠØ© Ø¹ÙŠÙ†Ù‡ Ø·ÙŠØ¨Ø§Ø±ÙŠÙˆØ³ Ù‚ÙŠØµØ±ØŒ ÙˆÙƒØ§Ù† Ù‚Ø¯ ØªÙˆÙ„Ù‰ Ø§Ù„ÙŠÙ‡ÙˆØ¯ÙŠØ© Ù…Ø¯Ø© Ø¹Ø´Ø±Ø© Ø³Ù†ÙˆØ§Øª (Ø³ØªØ§Ù‹ Ù…Ù†Ù‡Ù… Ù‚Ø¨Ù„ ØµÙ„Ø¨ Ø§Ù„Ø³ÙŠØ¯ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø³ÙŠØ­ ÙˆØ£Ø±Ø¨Ø¹Ø§Ù‹ Ø¨Ø¹Ø¯ Ù‚ÙŠØ§Ù…ØªÙ‡).

He was the second son of Herod the Great and from his fourth wife, Miltaki. Like his father before him, he craved glory, and indulged in grandeur and extravagance. He is the one the Master called a fox (Lk 13:32). Also, like his father, he had spent grand sums on community buildings. He built Tiberius in honor of the emperor Tiberius Caesar. When his wife, Herodias, urged him to go to Rome to seek the royal title, Emperor Caligula removed him from his position, and exiled him to Leon in Gaul for his trespasses.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            Â ÙˆÙ„Ù…Ø§ ÙƒØ§Ù† Ø¨ÙŠÙ„Ø§Ø·Ø³ Ø­Ø§Ø¦Ø±Ø§Ù‹ Ù?Ù‰ Ù…Ø§Ø°Ø§ ÙŠÙ?Ø¹Ù„ Ù„ÙŠØªØ®Ù„Øµ Ù…Ù† Ø¥Ø¯Ø§Ù†ØªÙ‡ Ù„Ù„Ø³ÙŠØ¯ Ù„Ù‡ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø¬Ø¯ Ùˆ Ø°ÙƒØ± Ø£Ù…Ø§Ù…Ù‡ Ø£Ù† Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø®Ù„Øµ Ù…Ù† Ø§Ù„Ø¬Ù„ÙŠÙ„ØŒ Ø®Ø·Ø± Ù?Ù‰ Ø¨Ø§Ù„Ù‡ Ø£Ù†Ù‡ ÙŠÙ…ÙƒÙ†Ù‡ Ø£Ù† ÙŠÙ?Ø®Ù„Ù‰ Ù†Ù?Ø³Ù‡ Ù…Ù† Ù‡Ø°Ù‡ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø³Ø¤ÙˆÙ„ÙŠØ© Ø¨Ø¥Ø±Ø³Ø§Ù„Ù‡ Ø¥Ù„Ù‰ Ù‡ÙŠØ±ÙˆØ¯Ø³ Ø§Ù†ØªÙŠØ¨Ø§Ø³ Ø±Ø¦ÙŠØ³ Ø§Ù„Ø±Ø¨Ø¹ Ù?Ù‰ Ø§Ù„Ø¬Ù„ÙŠÙ„ (Ù„Ùˆ3: 1).

Herod begged Him to perform a miracle before his eyes, but again, the Lord with His divine wisdom refrained.

As such, Pilate still insisted on releasing Jesus. He declared he would scourge Him and release Him, hoping this would appease the Jewish nation, especially the priests. This pleased no one, but rather those present shouted loudly, â€œCrucify this Man and release to us Barabbas!â€? (Cf. Lk 23:18) (which means son of â€˜Abbasâ€™).

No greater or clearer evidence could be presented, only the demise of the Pharisees and their supports in the hypocritical scheme to fiercely ask the Roman ruler to release the transgressor, Barabbas, and condemn the righteous Savior. â€œWhen Pilate saw that he could not prevail at all, but rather that a tumult was rising, he took water and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, â€˜I am innocent of the blood of this just Person. You see to itâ€™â€? (Mt 27:24; Duet 21:6â€“9). These words did not acquit Pilate. Although, he did truly wash his hands with water, yet this did not wash his heart from transgressionâ€”he did deliver to death One whom he had judged as innocent, simply because the cries of the crowd contradicted his conviction. When he could not convince the high priests and rulers of His innocence, he delivered the Savior to scourging first, in hopes that would satiate them, but to his disappointment, it was not enough, and the high priest and rulers demanded the crucifixion, which Pilate was compelled to execute.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            Ù…Ù…Ø§ ÙŠØ³ØªØ­Ù‚ Ø§Ù„Ø§Ù„ØªÙ?Ø§ØªØŒ Ø£Ù† Ø¨Ø§Ø±Ø§Ø¨Ø§Ø³ ÙƒØ§Ù† Ù…Ø¬Ø±Ù…Ø§Ù‹ Ø¨Ø°Ø§Øª Ø§Ù„Ø¬Ø±Ù… Ø§Ù„Ø°Ù‰ Ø§Ø¯Ø¹Ù‰ Ø¨Ù‡ Ø±Ø¤Ø³Ø§Ø¡ Ø§Ù„ÙƒÙ‡Ù†Ø© ÙƒØ°Ø¨Ø§Ù‹ Ø¹Ù„Ù‰ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø®Ù„Øµ ÙˆÙ‡Ùˆ Ø§Ù„Ù?ØªÙ†Ø©.

Jews only exposed the upper body part of the one to be scourged, while Romans exposed the whole body. For Jews, the whips had a limitâ€”forty minus oneâ€”but the Romans observed no such limit, used extreme severity, and showed no compassion. Void of human emotions, they would whip criminals mercilessly and quite often criminals died under scourging. In fact, scourging was forbidden on Romans, and was designated for slaves and people from other nations under the Roman rule, whom they also classified as slaves (Acts 22:25).         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            ÙˆÙƒØ§Ù† Ø§Ù„Ø¬Ù„Ø¯ Ø¹Ù†Ø¯ Ø§Ù„Ø±ÙˆÙ…Ø§Ù†ÙŠÙŠÙ† Ù?Ø¸ÙŠØ¹Ø§Ù‹ Ø¬Ø¯Ø§Ù‹ØŒ Ø¨Ù„ ÙƒØ§Ù† Ø§Ù‚Ø³Ù‰ ÙƒØ«ÙŠØ±Ø§Ù‹ Ù…Ù† Ø¬Ù„Ø¯ Ø§Ù„ÙŠÙ‡ÙˆØ¯ØŒ Ù„Ø§Ù† Ø§Ù„ÙŠÙ‡ÙˆØ¯ ÙƒØ§Ù†ÙˆØ§ ÙŠØ¹Ø±ÙˆÙ† Ù?Ù‚Ø· Ø§Ù„Ø¬Ø²Ø¡ Ø§Ù„Ø§Ø¹Ù„Ù‰ Ù…Ù† Ø¬Ø³Ø¯ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø±ØºÙˆØ¨ Ù?Ù‰ Ø¬Ù„Ø¯Ù‡ØŒ Ø£Ù…Ø§ Ø§Ù„Ø±ÙˆÙ…Ø§Ù†ÙŠÙˆÙ† Ù?ÙƒØ§Ù†ÙˆØ§ ÙŠØ¹Ø±ÙˆÙ† Ø§Ù„Ø¬Ø³Ø¯ ÙƒÙ„Ù‡.

The intention was to mock Jesus for proclaiming Himself a King. All their derision, however, was preordained by God to serve His divine purpose. What they used to mock Jesus, He used to establish Him as a King. The purple and scarlet robe is as a symbol that He is victorious; He was crowned with thorns because He is the King of heaven and earth; and a reed was placed in His hand because He clutches the scepter of sovereignty.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            Ø¨Ø¹Ø¯ Ù…Ø§ Ø¬Ù?Ù„Ø¯ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø®Ù„Øµ Ù„Ù‡ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø¬Ø¯ Ù†Ø²Ø¹ÙˆØ§ Ø«ÙŠØ§Ø¨Ù‡ ÙˆØ§Ù„Ø¨Ø³ÙˆÙ‡ Ø«ÙˆØ¨Ø§Ù‹ Ù‚Ø±Ù…Ø²ÙŠØ§Ù‹ØŒ ÙˆÙ‡Ùˆ Ù…Ø§ ÙƒØ§Ù† ÙŠÙ„Ø¨Ø³Ù‡ Ø±Ø¤Ø³Ø§Ø¡ Ø§Ù„Ø¬ÙŠØ´ØŒ Ù„ÙƒÙ†Ù‡Ù… Ø§Ù„Ø¨Ø³ÙˆÙ‡ Ø¥ÙŠØ§Ù‡ ÙƒØ§Ø­ØªÙ‚Ø§Ø± Ù„Ù‡ Ù„Ø§Ù†Ù‡Ù… Ø²Ø¹Ù…ÙˆØ§ Ø£Ù† Ù…Ø®Ù„ØµÙ†Ø§ Ù„Ù‡ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø¬Ø¯ Ø¥Ø¯Ù‘ÙŽØ¹Ù‰ Ø¨Ø§Ù†Ù‡ Ù…Ù„ÙƒØŒ ØºÙŠØ± Ø£Ù† Ù…Ø§ ØµÙ†Ø¹ÙˆÙ‡ Ø¨Ù‡ Ù…Ù† Ø§Ø³ØªÙ‡Ø²Ø§Ø¡ Ù‚Ø¯ ØªØ¹ÙŠÙ† Ù…Ù† Ù‚Ø¨Ù„ Ø§Ù„Ù„Ù‡ Ù„ÙŠØ¯Ù„ Ø¹Ù„Ù‰ Ù…Ø¹Ø§Ù†Ù‰ Ø¥Ù„Ø§Ù‡ÙŠØ©ØŒ ÙˆØªØ¹ÙŠØ±Ù‡Ù… Ù„Ù‡ Ø¥Ø³ØªØ®Ø¯Ù… Ø¨Ø§Ù„Ø£ÙƒØ«Ø± Ù„ÙŠØ«Ø¨Øª Ø¥Ù†Ù‡ Ù…Ù„Ùƒ: Ù?Ø§Ù†Ù‡Ù… Ù‚Ø¯ Ø£Ù?Ù„Ø¨Ø³ÙˆÙ‡ Ø§Ù„Ù‚Ø±Ù…Ø² ÙˆØ§Ù„Ø§Ø±Ø¬ÙˆØ§Ù† Ù„Ø£Ù†Ù‡ ØºØ§Ù„Ø¨.

But when He had tasted it, He would not drinkâ€? (Mt 27:34). Most probably those who gave the Lord of glory this drink were Jews, as this was not a custom for the Romans. Jews offered this drink to whomever was condemned to death at their execution because the rabbis declared this to be godly and righteous, based on the Sageâ€™s advice: â€œGive strong drink to him who is perishing, and wine to those who are bitter of heart. Let him drink and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no moreâ€? (Prov 31:6â€“7). It seems that the Lord Christ tasted it out of courtesy to the one who offered this good deed, but refrained from drinking it, preferring to thoroughly feel His Passion, not wanting to distort His clarity of mind, and to sense all the pains of His crucifixion with full cognizance: â€œShall I not drink the cup which My Father has given Me?â€? (Jn 18:11). As for the drink, it was of bitter herbs like wormwood mingled with poppy seed juice and acidic wine (differing slightly from vinegar). The intention in blending it with the wine was to provide a potent effect, so that by simply drinking from it, the crucified becomes oblivious to being dead or alive.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            Ù?Ù„Ù…Ø§ ÙˆØµÙ„ÙˆØ§ Ø¨Ù‡ Ø§Ù„ÙŠ Ø°Ù„Ùƒ Ø§Ù„Ù…ÙƒØ§Ù† Ø£Ø¹Ø·ÙˆÙ‡ Ø®Ù„Ø§Ù‹ Ù…Ù…Ø²ÙˆØ¬Ø§Ù‹ Ø¨Ù…Ø±Ø§Ø±Ø© Ù„ÙŠØ´Ø±Ø¨ ÙˆÙ„Ù…Ø§ Ø°Ø§Ù‚ Ù„Ù… ÙŠØ±Ø¯ Ø£Ù† ÙŠØ´Ø±Ø¨ (Ù…Øª 27: 34)ØŒ ÙˆÙ…Ù† Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø±Ø¬Ø­ Ø£Ù† Ø§Ù„Ø°ÙŠÙ† Ù‚Ø¯Ù…ÙˆØ§ Ù„Ù„Ø³ÙŠØ¯ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø³ÙŠØ­ Ù„Ù‡ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø¬Ø¯ Ù‡Ø°Ø§ Ø§Ù„Ø´Ø±Ø§Ø¨ Ù‡Ù… Ù…Ù† Ø§Ù„ÙŠÙ‡ÙˆØ¯ Ù„Ø§Ù†Ù‡ Ù„Ù… ÙŠÙƒÙ† Ø°Ù„Ùƒ Ù…Ù† Ø¹ÙˆØ§Ø¦Ø¯ Ø§Ù„Ø±ÙˆÙ…Ø§Ù†ØŒ ÙˆÙ„Ø§Ù† Ø§Ù„ÙŠÙ‡ÙˆØ¯ ÙƒØ§Ù†ÙˆØ§ ÙŠØªØ¨Ø±Ø¹ÙˆÙ† Ø¨Ù‡ Ù„ÙƒÙ„ Ù…Ø­ÙƒÙˆÙ… Ø¹Ù„ÙŠÙ‡ Ø¨Ø§Ù„Ù…ÙˆØª Ø¹Ù†Ø¯ Ù‚ØªÙ„Ù‡.

In addition to the crucifixion and scourging, our Lord endured consistent mockery and derision throughout this horrible ordeal. There was great pain arising from the duration the crucified remained alive (three days or longer), being drenched in sweat, hungry, and feverish (from inflamed wounds). The crucified was placed in such a position that the slightest movement caused extreme sharp pain to penetrate throughout his whole body from the strain of the nails in his hands and feet. Likewise, the blood accumulating in the lungs and pressing on the heart caused indescribable and excruciating pain accompanied by great thirst. Crucifixion was humiliating to the extent that Romans would never execute such a ruling against a Roman; it was reserved for slaves, thieves, the insubordinate, and criminals.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            â€œØ­ÙŠÙ†Ø¦Ø° ØµÙ„Ø¨ÙˆØ§ ÙŠØ³ÙˆØ¹â€?

When they reached the crucifixion site, they would strip them and offer them an intoxicant (as described earlier). For Jews, crucifixion was not a form of punishment. It was forbidden for a Jew to crucify a Jew. As for the comment in the Torah about hanging on the wood [â€œHe who is hanged is accursed of Godâ€? (Deut 21:23)], it is what is generally known today as hanging. Crucifixion originated in Persia, where it was used as a punishment for Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans. Alexander the Great, in conquering the city of Tyre, crucified 2,000 of its residents. Romans did not decree upon Romans death by crucifixion, but reserved it for slaves, persons committing the vilest crimes, and the inhabitants of countries they conquered (whom they classified as slaves). The Roman ruler, Crispus, decorated the path from the city of Kibeu to the city of Rome with the crosses of those who offended the Roman Empire. Caesar Augustus crucified 6,000 slaves on the Island of Sicily because they disobeyed him.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            ÙƒØ§Ù† Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø­ÙƒÙˆÙ… Ø¹Ù„ÙŠÙ‡Ù… Ø¨Ø§Ù„ØµÙ„Ø¨ ÙŠØ¬Ù„Ø¯ÙˆÙ† Ø£ÙˆÙ„Ø§ Ø«Ù… ÙŠØ­Ù…Ù„ÙˆÙ† Ø§Ù„ØµÙ„ÙŠØ¨ Ø§Ù„Ù‰ Ù…Ø­Ù„ Ø§Ù„ØµÙ„Ø¨ Ø§Ù„Ø°Ù‰ ÙƒØ§Ù† ÙŠØ¹ÙŠÙ† Ù?Ù‰ Ù…ÙƒØ§Ù† Ù…Ø´Ù‡ÙˆØ± Ø®Ø§Ø±Ø¬ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø¯ÙŠÙ†Ø© Ø­ÙŠØ« ÙŠØ¬ØªÙ…Ø¹ ÙƒØ«ÙŠØ±ÙˆÙ† Ù…Ù† Ø§Ù„Ù†Ø§Ø³ØŒ ÙˆØ°Ù„Ùƒ Ù„Ø£Ø¬Ù„ Ø¥Ø­ØªÙ‚Ø§Ø±Ù‡Ù… ÙˆØ§Ù„Ø¥Ø³ØªÙ‡Ø²Ø§Ø¡ Ø¨Ù‡Ù… Ù„ÙŠØµØ¨Ø­ÙˆØ§ Ø¹Ø¨Ø±Ø© Ù„ØºÙŠØ±Ù‡Ù….

One method was to erect the cross, and lift up the crucified and nail him while in the air. Most often, after removing the crucifiedâ€™s clothes, they would place the cross horizontally on the ground, and stretch him out on it and nail his hands and feet to the wood of the cross. Often times, they would only nail the hands, and tie the legs to the cross with ropes. They would position the cross vertically, and elevate the person being crucified, crucifying him while suspended above ground. As for our Lord of gloryâ€™s crucifixion, it was by nailing the hands and feet (as confirmed in the Gospel according to St. Luke (Lk 24:39â€“40)). Then they would lift up the cross with the crucified, and erect it vertically into the hole prepared for this sole purpose. Sometimes, they would thrust the cross into the hole with great speed and violently, that it would magnify the crucifiedâ€™s pain and suffering. The crucified was about one handbreadth above the ground. When the soldiers nailed our Savior to the cross, He prayed saying, â€œFather, forgive them, for they do not know what they doâ€? (Lk 23:34).         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            ÙˆÙƒØ§Ù† Ø§Ù„ØµÙ„ÙŠØ¨ ÙŠÙ?Ø±ÙƒØ¨ Ù…Ù† Ù‚Ø·Ø¹ØªÙŠÙ† Ù…ØªØ¹Ø§Ø±Ø¶ØªÙŠÙ† Ù…Ù† Ø§Ù„Ø®Ø´Ø¨ Ù?Ù‰ Ø¥Ø­Ø¯Ø§Ù‡Ù…Ø§ Ø¹Ù…ÙˆØ¯ ÙŠØ¯Ø®Ù„ Ø¨ÙŠÙ† Ø±Ø¬Ù„Ù‰ Ø§Ù„Ù…ØµÙ„ÙˆØ¨ Ù„ÙŠØ­Ù…Ù„ Ø¨Ø¹Ø¶ Ø«Ù‚Ù„Ù‡ Ù„Ø¦Ù„Ø§ ÙŠØªÙ…Ø²Ù‚ Ù…Ø­Ù„ Ù…Ø¯Ø®Ù„ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø³Ø§Ù…ÙŠØ± Ù?ÙŠØ³Ù‚Ø· Ø§Ù„Ù…ØµÙ„ÙˆØ¨.

For Pilate, the accusation against the Lord Christ was: â€œTHIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWSâ€? (Mt 27:37). Thus, the insignia was written in the three popular languages in Syria at that time: Hebrew, Greek, and Latin. By inscribing this sign, Pilate intended to ridicule and mock the Jews by crucifying their king. The chief priests objected to the inscription, but he did not care for, or pay attention to their protests and said, â€œWhat I have written, I have writtenâ€? (Jn 19:22). Therefore, the title that the wise men gave Christ at His birth glorifying Him, Pilate also gave to Him at His death.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            ÙˆÙƒØ§Ù†Øª Ø§Ù„Ø¹Ø§Ø¯Ø© Ø£Ù† ÙŠØ­Ù…Ù„ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø­ÙƒÙˆÙ… Ø¹Ù„ÙŠÙ‡ Ø¨Ø§Ù„ØµÙ„Ø¨ Ø¥Ø¹Ù„Ø§Ù† Ø§Ù„Ø¹Ù„Ø© Ø§Ù„ØªÙ‰ ØµÙ?Ù„Ø¨ Ù„Ø£Ø¬Ù„Ù‡Ø§ Ø­ØªÙ‰ Ø¥Ø°Ø§ ÙˆØµÙ„ÙˆØ§ Ù…Ø­Ù„ Ø§Ù„ØµÙ„Ø¨ ØªÙ?ÙˆØ¶ÙŽØ¹ Ù?ÙˆÙ‚ Ø±Ø£Ø³Ù‡.

They arrested Him in an inhuman way, treated Him with barbaric cruelty, and bound Him and took Him like a criminal to the council of Caiaphas and Annas, while slapping, beating, and spitting on His honorable face. They branded Him with their unjust judgment and handed Him to Pilate. Pilate, then, dressed Him in white (in the appearance of a lunatic) and sent Him to Herod, who after examining Him and finding no reason deserving of death, sent Him back to Pilate, who was compelled to condemn Him to death after scourging. The Jews bribed the scourgers to kill Him under the whips, so they whipped Him with all their brutality, so much so, that they tore apart His pure body. In staying on course with their viciousness, they placed on His holy head, instead of a diadem, a crown of thorns sharper than nails, which penetrated His forehead; and instead of a royal robe, they placed on His shoulders a red robe; and instead of the scepter of rule, they handed Him a reed.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            Ø¥Ø³Ù…Ø¹ÙˆØ§ Ø£ÙŠÙ‡Ø§ Ø§Ù„Ø£Ø­Ø¨Ø§Ø¡ Ø°ÙƒØ± Ù…Ø§ Ù‚Ø§Ø³Ø§Ù‡ Ù…Ø®Ù„ØµÙ†Ø§ Ù„Ù‡ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø¬Ø¯ Ù…Ù† Ø§Ù„Ø¢Ù„Ø¢Ù…Ø§Øª Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø¨Ø±Ø­Ø© Ù…Ù† Ø§Ù„ÙŠÙ‡ÙˆØ¯ØŒ Ù?Ø¥Ù†Ù‡Ù… Ù‚Ø¨Ø¶ÙˆØ§ Ø¹Ù„ÙŠÙ‡ Ø¨Ø´ÙƒÙ„ Ù„Ø§ ÙŠØªÙ?Ù‚ Ù…Ø¹ Ø§Ù„Ø¥Ù†Ø³Ø§Ù†ÙŠØ©ØŒ ÙˆØ¹Ø§Ù…Ù„ÙˆÙ‡ Ø¨Ù‚Ø³ÙˆØ© Ø¨Ø±Ø¨Ø±ÙŠØ©ØŒ Ù?Ø£Ø®Ø°ÙˆÙ‡ Ù…ÙˆØ«Ù‚Ø§Ù‹ Ø§Ù„Ù‰ Ù…Ø¬Ù„Ø³ Ù‚ÙŠØ§Ù?Ø§ ÙˆØ­Ù†Ø§Ù† Ø¨ÙŠÙ† Ù„ÙŽØ·Ù’Ù… ÙˆØ¶ÙŽØ±Ù’Ø¨ ÙˆØ¨ÙŽØµÙ’Ù‚ Ø¹Ù„Ù‰ Ø§Ù„ÙˆØ¬Ù‡ Ø§Ù„ÙƒØ±ÙŠÙ…ØŒ ÙˆØ¥Ø³ØªÙ‡Ø²Ø§Ø¡ Ø¨Ù‡ ÙƒÙ…Ø¬Ø±Ù… ÙˆÙ‡Ùˆ Ø§Ù„Ø¨Ø§Ø± Ø§Ù„Ù‚Ø¯ÙˆØ³.

On His journey were the mocking of the crowds, the derision of rivals, the attacks of the vulgar, the insults of bandits, and the vengeance of the enemies. He agonized under it at the throes of death, and sometimes fell upon the stones, and rose againâ€”pale faced, drained of strength, and drenched in blood until He reached the Golgotha altar. There, He was laid on the cross to be pierced by the nails penetrating His body to the cross. Thus, Isaiahâ€™s prophecy was fulfilled: â€œHe has no form or comeliness; and when we see Him, there is no beauty that we should desire Him. He is despised and rejected by men, a Man of sorrows and acquainted with grief. And we hid, as it were, our faces from Him; He was despised, and we did not esteem Him. Surely He has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows; yet we esteemed Him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted. But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquitiesâ€? (Is 53:2-5). Nature was affected by this scene: the sun untimely hid its raysâ€”ashamed to see its Creator hanging naked on the Cross; creation stared at Him as did shameless Ham (Gen 9:22â€“23); the earth shook in shock and the rocks split in horror over the Lord of glory, as if saying, â€œLet me swallow the wicked ones who do not know their Creator, by whom they live, move, and have their beingâ€? (Acts 17:28), as it swallowed Korah, Dathan, and Abiram (Num 16:31â€“32).         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            ÙˆÙ‚Ø¯ Ø£ØªØ®Ù† Ø¬Ø³Ø¯Ù‡ Ø¨Ø§Ù„Ø¬Ø±Ø§Ø­ Ù…Ù† Ø¬Ø±Ø§Ø¡ Ø­Ù…Ù„ Ø§Ù„ØµÙ„ÙŠØ¨ Ø§Ù„Ø¶Ø®Ù… Ø§Ù„Ø«Ù‚ÙŠÙ„ Ø³Ø§Ø¦Ø±Ø§Ù‹ Ø¨Ù‡ Ù?Ù‰ Ø´ÙˆØ§Ø±Ø¹ Ø£ÙˆØ±Ø´Ù„ÙŠÙ…ØŒ Ø¨ÙŠÙ† Ø³Ø®Ø±ÙŠØ© Ø§Ù„Ø¬Ù…Ø¹ØŒ ÙˆØ¥Ù‡Ø§Ù†Ø© Ø§Ù„Ø®ØµÙˆÙ…ØŒ ÙˆØªÙ‡ÙƒÙ… Ø§Ù„Ø³Ù?Ù„Ø©ØŒ ÙˆØ´ØªØ§Ø¦Ù… Ø§Ù„Ø§Ø¬Ù„Ø§Ù?ØŒ ÙˆØªØ´Ù?Ù‰ Ø§Ù„Ø§Ø¹Ø¯Ø§Ø¡ØŒ ÙŠØ¦Ù† ØªØ­ØªÙ‡ Ø£Ù†ÙŠÙ† Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø­ØªØ¶Ø±ØŒ Ù?ÙŠÙ‚Ø¹ ØªØ§Ø±Ø© Ø¹Ù„ÙŠ Ø§Ù„Ø­Ø¬Ø§Ø±Ø© ÙˆÙŠÙ†Ù‡Ø¶ Ø£Ø®Ø±Ù‰ØŒ Ø®Ø§Ø¦Ø± Ø§Ù„Ù‚ÙˆÙ‰ØŒ Ø´Ø§Ø­Ø¨ Ø§Ù„ÙˆØ¬Ù‡ØŒ Ø¯Ø§Ù…Ù‰ Ø§Ù„Ø§Ø¹Ø¶Ø§Ø¡ØŒ Ø­ØªÙ‰ Ø¨Ù„Øº Ù…Ø°Ø¨Ø­ Ø§Ù„Ø¬Ù„Ø¬Ù„Ø©ØŒ ÙˆÙ‡Ù†Ø§Ùƒ Ø¬Ø±Ù‰ Ù…Ù‚ØªÙ„Ù‡ Ø¨Ø­Ø±Ø§Ø¨ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø³Ø§Ù…ÙŠØ± Ø¹Ù„Ù‰ Ø§Ù„ØµÙ„ÙŠØ¨ØŒ [Ù?ÙƒÙ…Ù„Øª Ù†Ø¨ÙˆØ© Ø£Ø´Ø¹ÙŠØ§Ø¡ Ù‚Ø§Ø¦Ù„Ø§Ù‹ "Ù„Ø§ ØµÙˆØ±Ø© Ù„Ù‡ ÙˆÙ„Ø§ Ø¬Ù…Ø§Ù„ Ù?Ù†Ù†Ø¸Ø± Ø§Ù„ÙŠÙ‡ ÙˆÙ„Ø§ Ù…Ù†Ø¸Ø± Ù?Ù†Ø´ØªÙ‡ÙŠÙ‡ØŒ Ù…Ø­ØªÙ‚Ø± ÙˆÙ…Ø®Ø°ÙˆÙ„ Ù…Ù† Ø§Ù„Ù†Ø§Ø³ØŒ Ø±Ø¬Ù„ Ø£ÙˆØ¬Ø§Ø¹ ÙˆÙ…Ø®ØªØ¨Ø± Ø§Ù„Ø­Ø²Ù†ØŒ ÙˆÙƒÙ…Ø³Ù‘ÙŽØªØ± Ø¹Ù†Ù‡ ÙˆØ¬ÙˆÙ‡Ù†Ø§ØŒ Ù…Ø­ØªÙ‚Ø± Ù?Ù„Ù… Ù†Ø¹ØªØ¯ Ø¨Ù‡ØŒ Ù„ÙƒÙ† Ø£Ø­Ø²Ø§Ù†Ù†Ø§ Ø­Ù…Ù„Ù‡Ø§ØŒ ÙˆØ£ÙˆØ¬Ø§Ø¹Ù†Ø§ ØªØ­Ù…Ù„Ù‡Ø§ØŒ ÙˆÙ†Ø­Ù† Ø­Ø³Ø¨Ù†Ø§Ù‡ Ù…ØµØ§Ø¨Ø§Ù‹ Ù…Ø¶Ø±ÙˆØ¨Ø§Ù‹ Ù…Ù† Ø§Ù„Ù†Ø§Ø³ ÙˆÙ…Ø°Ù„ÙˆÙ„Ø§Ù‹.

(Mt 27:46; Ps 22:1; cf. Heb 5:7). (It appeared in the Gospel according to St. Mark as, â€œEloi, Eloiâ€? (Mk 15:34), a similar expression, except that our teacher, St. Mark, transcribed it in the Syrian language, as the Lord Christ pronounced it). This bitter depression and great anguish pushed our Savior to this horrific outcry: â€œMy God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?â€? because He felt the extent of the pain that He bore for the sake of our sins while on the Cross. He stood instead of us before Divine Justice to pay our dues. He tasted death for every person (Heb 2:9), and became sin for us, He, who knows no sin, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him (Cf. 2 Cor 5:21). This fulfills what Isaiah said: â€œYet it pleased the Lord to bruise Him; He has put Him to grief. When You make His soul an offering for sinâ€¦ But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement for our peace was upon Him, and by His stripes we are healedâ€? (Is 53:10,5), St. Peter also said: â€œ[Christ] suffered once for sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us to Godâ€?

Now a vessel full of sour wine was sitting there; and they filled a sponge with sour wine, put it on hyssop, and put it to His mouth. So when Jesus had received the sour wine, He said, "It is finished!" And bowing His head, He gave up His spirit (JnÂ 19:28-30). After this, Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and gave up the spirit (Mt 27:50; Mk 15:37; Lk 23:46); perhaps, this cry was the shout of joy because He had fulfilled our redemption.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            "Ø¨ÙŽØ¹Ù’Ø¯ÙŽ Ù‡ÙŽØ°ÙŽØ§ Ø±ÙŽØ£ÙŽÙ‰ ÙŠÙŽØ³Ù?ÙˆØ¹Ù?

Thus, He died according to His Humanity, while His Divinity did not part from His body for a single moment nor a twinkle of an eye, not before crucifixion, during, nor after crucifixion. In declaring this, we say that it is impossible for the Lord Christ to be two personsâ€”one contradicting the other: one born and the other not. One cannot amaze with wonders, while the other receives mockery; neither can one be crucified while the other not crucified. The one born, the wonderworker, and the crucified are all one. This is the apostolic faith, the concurrence of the evangelists, and the fathersâ€™ aphorisms.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            Ù?Ø¹Ù†Ø¯ Ù…ÙˆØªÙ‡ Ø£Ø³Ù„Ù… Ø±ÙˆØ­Ù‡ Ø§Ù„Ø·Ø§Ù‡Ø±Ø© Ù‚Ø§Ø¦Ù„Ø§ Ù„Ø£Ø¨ÙŠÙ‡: "ÙŠØ§ Ø£Ø¨ØªØ§Ù‡ Ù?ÙŠ ÙŠØ¯ÙŠÙƒ Ø£Ø³ØªÙˆØ¯Ø¹ Ø±ÙˆØ­Ù‰" ÙˆÙ‡ÙƒØ°Ø§ Ù…Ø§Øª Ø¨Ù†Ø§Ø³ÙˆØªÙ‡ ÙˆÙ…Ø¹ Ø°Ù„Ùƒ Ù„Ø§Ù‡ÙˆØªÙ‡ Ù„Ù… ÙŠÙ?Ø§Ø±Ù‚ Ù†Ø§Ø³ÙˆØªÙ‡ Ø£Ù‰ Ø¬Ø³Ø¯Ù‡ Ù„Ø­Ø¸Ø© ÙˆØ§Ø­Ø¯Ø© ÙˆÙ„Ø§ Ø·Ø±Ù?Ø© Ø¹ÙŠÙ† Ù„Ø§ Ù‚Ø¨Ù„ Ø§Ù„ØµÙ„Ø¨ ÙˆÙ„Ø§ Ø­ÙŠÙ† Ø§Ù„ØµÙ„Ø¨ ÙˆÙ„Ø§ Ø¨Ø¹Ø¯ Ø§Ù„ØµÙ„Ø¨.

Church history, taken from early tradition, mentions that when Joseph and Nicodemus came to embalm the Master, Joseph held His hand and said, â€œWould this awesome hand that created all die, and could I now embalm it!â€? Christ opened His eyes and smiled, at which Joseph cried out, â€œHoly God, Holy Mighty, Holy Immortal.â€? Hence, the Church arranged this chant among her hymns for Passion Week.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            ÙˆÙ…Ù…Ø§ ÙŠØ¨Ø±Ù‡Ù† Ø¹Ù„Ù‰ Ø¹Ø¯Ù… Ù…ÙˆØªÙ‡ Ø¥Ù†Ù‡ Ù„Ù…Ø§ Ø·Ø¹Ù†Ù‡ Ø£Ø­Ø¯ Ø§Ù„Ø¬Ù†ÙˆØ¯ Ø¨Ø§Ù„Ø­Ø±Ø¨Ø© Ø®Ø±Ø¬ Ù…Ù† Ø¬Ù†Ø¨Ù‡ Ù…Ø§Ø¡ Ø¹Ù„Ø§Ù…Ù‡ Ø¹Ù„Ù‰ Ø§Ù†Ù‡ Ø­Ù‰ ÙˆÙ„Ù† ÙŠÙ…ÙˆØª.

Since â€œthe wages of sin is deathâ€? (Rom 6:23), God, out of His abundant mercy did not wish the death of man whom He was about to create, so He planned his salvation before Adam appeared on the face of the earth. Salvation could not occur except through the mediation of an unblemished, righteous, Holy One, on whose mouth there is no deceit, who is outside the human race, and without sin. An angel, archangel, prophet, or saint could not fulfill this. The angelic nature differs from the human nature, and the prophets and saints were born with the original sin, which affects the whole human raceâ€”no one being is exempted. According to St. Paul, â€œTherefore, just as through one man sin entered the world, and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men, because all sinnedâ€? (Rom 5:12). Also, â€˜â€œThere is none righteous, no, not one; there is none who understands; there is none who seeks after God. They have all turned aside; they have together become unprofitable; there is none who does good, no, not oneâ€™â€? (Rom 3:10â€“12).         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            Ù‚Ø¨Ù„ Ø£Ù† ØªÙ?Ø®Ù„Ù‚ Ø§Ù„ÙƒØ§Ø¦Ù†Ø§ØªØŒ ÙˆÙ‚Ø¨Ù„ Ø£Ù† ØªØªØ¹ÙŠÙ† Ø§Ù„Ø§Ø²Ù…Ø§Ù†ØŒ Ø¹ÙŽÙ„Ù?Ù…ÙŽ Ø§Ù„Ù„Ù‡ Ø¨Ø³Ø§Ø¨Ù‚ Ø¹Ù?Ù„Ù…Ù‡ Ø£Ù† Ø§Ù„Ø§Ù†Ø³Ø§Ù† Ø³ÙŠØ®Ø·Ø¦ ÙˆÙŠØ¹Ù…Ù„ Ø§Ù„Ø´Ø± Ø¹Ù„Ù‰ Ø§Ù„Ø§Ø±Ø¶ØŒ ÙˆØ¨Ù…Ø§ Ø£Ù† "Ø£Ø¬Ø±Ø© Ø§Ù„Ø®Ø·ÙŠØ© Ù‡Ù‰ Ù…ÙˆØª" (Ø±Ùˆ6: 23)ØŒ ÙˆÙƒØ§Ù† Ø§Ù„Ù„Ù‡ Ù…Ù† Ù?Ø±Ø· Ø±Ø­Ù…ØªÙ‡ Ù„Ø§ ÙŠØ´Ø§Ø¡ Ø£Ù† ÙŠÙ‡Ù„Ùƒ Ø§Ù„Ø§Ù†Ø³Ø§Ù† Ø§Ù„Ø°Ù‰ Ù‡Ùˆ Ù…Ø²Ù…Ø¹ Ø£Ù† ÙŠØ®Ù„Ù‚Ù‡.

The Almighty God saw that this redemption could not be fulfilled except through the second hypostasis, through whom the creation was formed, as our teacher St. John the Evangelist testified: â€œAll things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was madeâ€? (Jn 1:3). Therefore, it was the responsibility of the One who created all things to be the Savior, and none other. â€œGod sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under the law, to redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption as sonsâ€? (Gal 4:4â€“5). Thus, He took the form of a servant, which was defiled by sin, to renew it once more and restore it to its original glory. All three hypostases participated in humanityâ€™s salvation: the Fatherâ€™s justice was fulfilled; the Son paid the debt for mankind; and the Holy Spirit remitted the sins.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            Ø¨Ù…Ø§ Ø¥Ù†Ù‡ Ù„Ø§ ÙŠÙ‚Ø¯Ø± Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø°Ù†Ø¨ Ø£Ù† ÙŠØ®Ù„Øµ Ù…Ø°Ù†Ø¨Ø§Ù‹ Ù…Ø«Ù„Ù‡ØŒ ÙƒÙ…Ø§ ÙˆØ£Ù† Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø­ØªØ§Ø¬ Ù„Ø§ ÙŠØ³Ø¯ Ø¹ÙˆØ² Ù…Ù† ÙŠØ´Ø¨Ù‡Ù‡ Ù?Ù‰ Ø§Ù„Ø§Ø­ØªÙŠØ§Ø¬ØŒ Ø±Ø£Ù‰ Ø§Ù„Ù„Ù‡ -Ù„Ù‡ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø¬Ø¯- Ø£Ù† Ù„Ø§ÙŠØªÙ… Ù‡Ø°Ø§ Ø§Ù„Ù?Ø¯Ø§Ø¡ Ø¥Ù„Ø§ Ø¨Ø§Ù„Ø§Ù‚Ù†ÙˆÙ… Ø§Ù„Ø«Ø§Ù†Ù‰ Ø§Ù„Ø°Ù‰ Ø¨ÙˆØ§Ø³Ø·ØªÙ‡ Ù‚Ø¯ ØµÙˆØ±Øª Ø§Ù„Ø®Ù„ÙŠÙ‚Ø© ÙƒÙ…Ø§ Ø´Ù‡Ø¯ Ø¨Ø°Ù„Ùƒ Ù…Ø¹Ù„Ù…Ù†Ø§ ÙŠÙˆØ­Ù†Ø§ Ø§Ù„Ø§Ù†Ø¬ÙŠÙ„Ù‰ "ÙƒÙ„ Ø´Ø¦ Ø¨Ù‡ ÙƒØ§Ù† ÙˆØ¨ØºÙŠØ±Ù‡ Ù„Ù… ÙŠÙƒÙ† Ø´Ø¦ Ù…Ù…Ø§ ÙƒØ§Ù†"(ÙŠÙˆ1: 3)ØŒ Ù?ÙˆØ¬Ø¨ Ø¨Ù…Ù† Ø£ÙˆØ¬Ø¯ Ø§Ù„Ù…ÙˆØ¬ÙˆØ¯Ø§Øª Ø£Ù† ÙŠÙƒÙˆÙ† Ø¨Ù‡ Ø§Ù„Ø®Ù„Ø§Øµ Ø¯ÙˆÙ† Ø³ÙˆØ§Ù‡ Ù?Ø£Ø±Ø³Ù„ Ø§Ù„Ù„Ù‡ Ø¥Ø¨Ù†Ù‡ØŒ Ù…ÙˆÙ„ÙˆØ¯Ø§Ù‹ Ù…Ù† Ø¥Ù…Ø±Ø£Ø©ØŒ Ù…ÙˆÙ„ÙˆØ¯Ø§Ù‹ ØªØ­Øª Ø§Ù„Ù†Ø§Ù…ÙˆØ³ Ù„ÙŠÙ?ØªØ¯ÙŠ Ø§Ù„Ø°ÙŠÙ† ØªØ­Øª Ø§Ù„Ù†Ø§Ù…ÙˆØ³ Ù„Ù†Ù†Ø§Ù„ Ø§Ù„ØªØ¨Ù†Ù‰ (ØºÙ„4: 4-5)ØŒ Ù?Ù„Ø¨Ø³ ØµÙˆØ±Ø© Ø§Ù„Ø§Ù†Ø³Ø§Ù† Ø§Ù„ØªÙ‰ ÙƒØ§Ù†Øª Ù‚Ø¯ Ø£Ù?Ø³Ø¯ØªÙ‡Ø§ Ø§Ù„Ø®Ø·ÙŠØ© Ù„ÙŠØ¬Ø¯Ø¯Ù‡Ø§ Ù…Ø±Ø© Ø«Ø§Ù†ÙŠØ© ÙˆÙŠØ¹ÙŠØ¯ Ù„Ù‡Ø§ Ù…Ø¬Ø¯Ù‡Ø§ Ø§Ù„Ø§ÙˆÙ„ØŒ ÙˆÙƒØ§Ù† Ø°Ù„Ùƒ Ø¨Ø§Ø¬Ù…Ø§Ø¹ Ø§Ù„Ø«Ù„Ø§Ø«Ø© Ø§Ù„Ø§Ù‚Ø§Ù†ÙŠÙ… Ø¹Ù„Ù‰ Ø®Ù„Ø§Øµ Ø§Ù„Ø§Ù†Ø³Ø§Ù†.

God was able to save man by a word, as He created him by a word, but because He is just, He saw that there was no forgiveness except by the shedding of blood. Therefore, there was a necessity for this amazing incarnation, one beyond nature, to fulfill Divine Justice: â€œThe soul who sins shall dieâ€? (Ezra 18:20). Godâ€™s mercy had to fulfill the work of redemption for sinful man. In this way, God is simultaneously just and merciful. Justice received its due by the death of the Son on the wood of the cross, and mercy interceded in fulfilling salvation. Thus, Godâ€™s justice and mercy were at equilibrium as each one was affirmed in accordance.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            Ù?Ù‡Ø°Ø§ Ø§Ù„Ø³Ø¨Ø¨ Ø§Ù„Ø°Ù‰ Ø¬Ø¹Ù„ Ø§Ù„Ù„Ù‡ Ø£Ù† ÙŠØªØ®Ø° ØµÙˆØ±Ø© Ø¹Ø¨Ø¯ ÙˆØ¬Ø³Ø¯ Ø§Ù†Ø³Ø§Ù† Ø®Ø§Ø·Ø¦ Ù„ÙŠØ¯ÙŠÙ† Ø§Ù„Ø®Ø·ÙŠØ© Ù?ÙŠ Ø§Ù„Ø¬Ø³Ø¯ ÙˆÙƒØ§Ù† Ø§Ù„Ù„Ù‡ Ù‚Ø§Ø¯Ø±Ø§Ù‹ Ø£Ù† ÙŠØ®Ù„Øµ Ø§Ù„Ø§Ù†Ø³Ø§Ù† Ø¨ÙƒÙ„Ù…Ø© ÙƒÙ…Ø§ Ø®Ù„Ù‚ Ø§Ù„Ø¹Ø§Ù„Ù… Ø¨ÙƒÙ„Ù…Ø© ÙˆÙ„ÙƒÙ† Ø¨Ù…Ø§ Ø§Ù†Ù‡ Ø¹Ø§Ø¯Ù„ Ø±Ø£Ù‰ Ø£Ù† Ù„Ø§ ØªØ­ØµÙ„ Ù…ØºÙ?Ø±Ø© Ø¥Ù„Ø§ Ø¨Ø³Ù?Ùƒ Ø¯Ù…ØŒ Ù?Ù„Ø°Ø§ Ù„Ø²Ù… Ù‡Ø°Ø§ Ø§Ù„ØªØ¬Ø³Ø¯ Ø§Ù„Ø¹Ø¬ÙŠØ¨ Ø§Ù„Ø°Ù‰ Ù…Ø§ Ù‡Ùˆ Ù?ÙˆÙ‚ Ø§Ù„Ø·Ø¨ÙŠØ¹Ø© ÙˆØ°Ù„Ùƒ ØªÙ†Ù?ÙŠØ°Ø§Ù‹ Ù„Ù„Ø¹Ø¯Ù„ Ø§Ù„Ø§Ù„Ù‡Ù‰ "Ø£Ù† Ø§Ù„Ù†Ù?Ø³ Ø§Ù„ØªÙ‰ ØªØ®Ø·Ø¦ Ù‡Ù‰ ØªÙ…ÙˆØª" (Ø¹Ø²18: 20 )ØŒ ÙˆØ¹Ù„ÙŠÙ‡ØŒ Ù?Ù‚Ø¯ Ø¥Ù‚ØªØ¶Øª Ø±Ø­Ù…Ø© Ø§Ù„Ù„Ù‡ Ø£Ù† ØªÙ‚ÙˆÙ… Ø¨Ø¹Ù…Ù„ Ø§Ù„ØªÙƒÙ?ÙŠØ± Ø¹Ù† Ø§Ù„Ø§Ù†Ø³Ø§Ù† Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø°Ù†Ø¨.

The death of the Lord of glory wiped out the handwriting against us, broke down the middle wall separating us from God, removed the enmity, brought us closer to Him, and reconciled us via His cross. St. Paul says, â€œFor it pleased the Father that in Him all the fullness should dwell, and by Him to reconcile all things to Himself, by Him, whether things on earth or things in heaven, having made peace through the blood of His crossâ€? (ColÂ 1:19â€“20). The Apostle Paul tells the Ephesians, â€œFor He Himself is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of separation, having abolished in His flesh the enmity, that is, the law of commandments contained in ordinances, so as to create in Himself one new man from the two, thus making peace, and that He might reconcile them both to God in one body through the cross, thereby putting to death the enmity. And He came and preached peace to you who were afar off and to those who were nearâ€? (Eph 2:14â€“17). The apostle also writes to the Romans, â€œFor if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His lifeâ€?

When no one kept the law, all were accursed; since death on the cross is a curse, He wanted to die the death of the cross to take away our curse, and send us the blessing, as the apostle says, â€œChrist has redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us (for it is written, â€˜Cursed is everyone who hangs on a treeâ€™ (Cf. Deut. 21:22-23)), that the blessing of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faithâ€?

He is a man of lofty stature, handsome, having a venerable countenance which the beholders can both love and fear. He has wavy hair, rather crisp, of a tinge, and glossy, flowing down from His shoulders, with a parting in the middle of the head after the manner of the Nazarenes.[40] His forehead is even and very serene, and His face without any wrinkle or spot, and beautiful with a slight blush. His nose and mouth are without fault; He has a beard abundant and reddish, of the color of His hair, not long but forked. His eyes are sparkling and bright. He is terrible in rebuke, calm and loving in admonition, cheerful but preserving gravity, has never been seen to laugh but often to weep. Thus, in stature of body, He is tall; and His hands and limbs are beautiful to look upon. In speech He is grave, reserved, and modest and He is fair among the children of men. He is claimed as the creator of heaven and earth and all that exists therein. Truly, every day we hear amazing news about this Jesus. His appearance overflows with reverence and awe. His eyes are like the rays of the sun, and no one could stare at Him from the brightness of His face. His arms and shoulders are exquisite. As for the meetings, in them he pleases many, yet rarely looks at them, and when He is present with them, He sits with the greatest propriety. So, in His appearance and form, He is the most beautiful person you could imagine, greatly resembling His mother who is the most beautiful young lady to be seen in this area. O king, if your majesty wishes to see Him, please inform me, whereby I will not delay in sending Him to you speedily. He has astonished the whole city of Jerusalem with His knowledge, knowing everything without having studied. Sometimes, He walks barefoot and bareheaded, and many, when they see Him laugh at Him, but in His presence or when speaking to Him, He confounds and astonishes. They say that there has never been heard of such a man in wisdom, and truthfully as the Jews have told me, we have not heard such wisdom from anyone like what this Jesus teaches. Many others come forward complaining to me of Him, saying that He opposes your laws, and you find me very indignant from those evil Jews. They say that He gives them many graces and much health, and in all cases I am ready to obey you; whatever your majesty commands me to do will be done with all speed.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            Ø£ÙŠÙ‡Ø§ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ù„Ùƒ Ø¥Ù†Ù†Ù‰ Ù?Ù‡Ù…Øª Ø£Ù†Ùƒ ØªØ±ØºØ¨ Ù…Ø¹Ø±Ù?Ø© Ù…Ø§ Ø£Ø®Ø¨Ø±Ùƒ Ø¨Ù‡ Ø§Ù„Ø¢Ù†.

This valley bore many names; the part falling southwest of Jerusalem is called Rabbabba Valley; in the Holy Bible it is called Valley of Hinnom (Josh 15:8; Neh 11:30), Valley of the son of Hinnom (Josh 15:8, 18:16), and Valley of the sons of Hinnom (KJV 2 Kg 23:10). It is a valley descending from the Hebron Gate to Jobâ€™s Well, separating Mount Zion from the Mount of Corruption. The southeastern portion of this valley is called Tophet (Jer 7:31; 2 Kg 23:10), or the Valley of Slaughter (Jer 7:32; 19:6), a border separating Benjamin and Judah. Solomon built on the southern crevice overlooking Tophet, the high places for Moab (1 Kg 11:7). Ahaz (2 Kg 16:3; 2 Chr 28:3) and Manasseh (2 Chr 33:6) passed their children through the fire in this valley. Josiah stopped this worship by desecrating the valley and the high places with human bones and other unclean objects, breaking the sacred pillars, and cutting down the wooden images (2 Kg 23:10,13,14). It became a place where all of the cityâ€™s rubbish was thrown out, and into where the entire cityâ€™s cesspool poured. Looking at what defiled this valley: Molechâ€™s fire, and the fire used to burn the rubbish, the Jews took to calling it Gehinnom [Hades] (land of Hinnom), making it a general location for punishment, throwing the bodies of the two thieves there. Had Joseph not come forward, asking Pilate for the body of the Lord Jesus, He would have been thrown with the thieves, as the Jewish rulers intended.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            ÙƒØ§Ù†ÙˆØ§ ÙŠØ·Ø±Ø­ÙˆÙ† Ø¬Ø«Ø« Ø§Ù„Ù‚ØªÙ„Ù‰ Ù?Ù‰ Ø­Ù?Ø±Ø© Ù?Ù‰ ÙˆØ§Ø¯Ù‰ Ù‡Ù†Ù‘ÙˆÙ….

Nicodemus supported Joseph in opposition to the ruling which the Jews passed against Jesus (Jn 7:50â€“52). They wrapped Him in pure linen which was only done by the rich, noble, and affluent. The linen was a long strip to be wrapped around the body several times. No doubt the spices were placed on the body, mingling with it, and then He was wrapped in the strip and placed in the tomb. As Almighty God previously appointed Joseph the carpenter to care for Jesus during His childhood, He now appointed another Joseph to bury Him.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            Ù?Ø£Ø®Ø° ÙŠÙˆØ³Ù?

It was not in the means of the Virgin Mary or the disciples to take the body, but Joseph, who was unknown at that time as a disciple, but as a rich noble man, took it with the greatest ease. Thus, Isaiahâ€™s prophecy was fulfilled: â€œAnd they made His grave with the wickedâ€”but with the rich at His deathâ€? (Is 53:9). Also, Nicodemus, who came to learn from Jesus three years earlier (Jn 3:2), appeared now accompanying Joseph and helped him in the preparations for burying the Savior. He was placed in a new tomb, in which no one had been placed before, because God had ordained that the One who would not see corruption would not be placed in a tomb with other corrupted bodies (Ps 16:10; Acts 2:31). How amazing are Godâ€™s care and economy!         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            ÙˆÙ‡Ù†Ø§ Ù†Ø±Ù‰ Ø£ÙŠØ¶Ø§Ù‹ Ø¹Ù†Ø§ÙŠØ© Ø§Ù„Ù„Ù‡ Ø§Ù„Ø¹Ø¸ÙŠÙ…Ø©ØŒ Ù?Ø£Ù†Ù‡ Ù„Ù… ÙŠÙƒÙ† Ù?Ù‰ ÙˆØ³Ø¹ Ø§Ù„Ø³ÙŠØ¯Ø© Ù…Ø±ÙŠÙ… Ø§Ù„Ø¹Ø°Ø±Ø§Ø¡ ÙˆÙ„Ø§ Ø§Ù„ØªÙ„Ø§Ù…ÙŠØ° Ø£Ù† ÙŠØ£Ø®Ø°ÙˆØ§ Ø§Ù„Ø¬Ø³Ø¯ØŒ ÙˆÙ„ÙƒÙ† "ÙŠÙˆØ³Ù?"

Thus, the time in which the Lord slept in the tomb was about 36 hours: part of Friday, Saturday (all day and night), and part of Sunday when He rose early. This duration is considered three days and three nights; this is a principle in the Talmud, such that adding one hour to a day counts as another day, and adding a day to a year counts as another year. The same principle was applied in Book of Esther (Esth 4:15â€“16), and this applies even today in our government. Most governments count one day of the year, a full year. For example, if a child is born on the last day of the year, the whole year is counted for him. Therefore, it is valid to say that the Lord Christ stayed in the tomb for three days and three nights, otherwise the Jews would have objected to the Christians and challenged the veracity of Christ for not fulfilling His promise of rising on the morning of the third day, but they never presented such an objection.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            Ø¥Ù† Ø¬Ø³Ø¯ Ø§Ù„Ø±Ø¨ Ù‚Ø¯ ÙˆØ¶Ù?Ø¹ÙŽ Ù?Ù‰ Ø§Ù„Ù‚Ø¨Ø± ÙŠÙˆÙ… Ø§Ù„Ø¬Ù…Ø¹Ø© Ù‚Ø¨Ù„ ØºØ±ÙˆØ¨ Ø§Ù„Ø´Ù…Ø³ØŒ ÙˆÙ‚Ø§Ù… Ù„Ù‡ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø¬Ø¯ Ù?Ù‰ ØµØ¨Ø§Ø­ Ø§Ù„Ø£Ø­Ø¯ Ø¨Ø§ÙƒØ±Ø§ØŒ Ù?ØªÙƒÙˆÙ† Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø¯Ø© Ø§Ù„ØªÙ‰ Ù†Ø§Ù…Ù‡Ø§ Ø§Ù„Ø³ÙŠØ¯ Ù?ÙŠ Ø§Ù„Ù‚Ø¨Ø± Ù†Ø­Ùˆ Ø³Øª ÙˆØ«Ù„Ø§Ø«ÙŠÙ† Ø³Ø§Ø¹Ø©ØŒ Ø¬Ø²Ø¡ Ù…Ù† ÙŠÙˆÙ… Ø§Ù„Ø¬Ù…Ø¹Ø©ØŒ ÙˆÙŠÙˆÙ… Ø§Ù„Ø³Ø¨Øª Ø¨Ù„ÙŠÙ„Ù‡ØŒ ÙˆØ¬Ø²Ø¡ Ù…Ù† ÙŠÙˆÙ… Ø§Ù„Ø£Ø­Ø¯ Ø§Ù„Ø°Ù‰ Ù‚Ø§Ù… Ù?ÙŠÙ‡ Ø¨Ø§ÙƒØ±Ø§Ù‹.
