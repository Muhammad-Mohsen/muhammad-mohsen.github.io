When His disciples were amazed (Mt 21:20; Mk 11:20-23), seeing that the fig tree which He had cursed had withered, He spoke to them about faith (Mk 11:24). Upon entering the temple that day, the Pharisees cunningly asked Jesus by what authority He does these things and who gave Him this authority. In His reply, He spoke of the baptism of John (Mt 21:23â€“27; Mk 11:27â€“33; Lk 20:1â€“8), the parable of the two sons (Mt 21:28â€“32), the parable of the evil vinedressers (Mt 21:33â€“46), and the parable of the kingâ€™s sonâ€™s wedding (Mt 22:1â€“14). The Pharisees then proceeded to challenge Him, and so, asked if it was right to pay taxes to Caesar (Mt 22:15â€“22), the Sadducees asked about resurrection, and the lawyer inquired about the first commandment (Mt 22:23â€“40). In return, Jesus asked the Pharisees about their conviction of Him, and in so doing exposed their hypocrisy (Mt 22:41â€“46). He warned the people and the disciples of the hypocrisy of the lawyers and Pharisees (Mk 12:38â€“40), pronounced the woes on the scribes and Pharisees, and cried over Jerusalem (Mt 23:13â€“39). He then praised the poor widow who cast into the treasury the two mites, which were her whole livelihood (Mk 12:41â€“44).         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            Ù?Ù„Ù…Ø§ Ø±Ø¬Ø¹ Ø§Ù„Ø³ÙŠØ¯ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø³ÙŠØ­ -Ù„Ù‡ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø¬Ø¯- Ù…Ù† Ø¨ÙŠØª Ø¹Ù†ÙŠØ§ Ù?ÙŠ ØµØ¨Ø§Ø­ ÙŠÙˆÙ… Ø§Ù„Ø«Ù„Ø§Ø«Ø§Ø¡ Ø¥Ù„Ù‰ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø¯ÙŠÙ†Ø© ÙˆØ±Ø£Ù‰ Ø§Ù„ØªÙ„Ø§Ù…ÙŠØ° Ø£Ù† Ø§Ù„ØªÙŠÙ†Ø© Ø§Ù„ØªÙ‰ Ù„Ø¹Ù†Ù‡Ø§ Ù‚Ø¯ ÙŠØ¨Ø³Øª Ù?ØªØ¹Ø¬Ø¨ÙˆØ§ (Ù…Øª21 :20)ØŒ (Ù…Ø±11: 20-23)ØŒ Ù?ÙƒÙ„Ù…Ù‡Ù… Ø¹Ù† Ø§Ù„Ø¥ÙŠÙ…Ø§Ù† (Ù…Ø±11: 24)ØŒ ÙˆØ­ÙŠÙ†Ù…Ø§ Ø¯Ø®Ù„ Ø±Ø¨Ù†Ø§ ÙŠØ³ÙˆØ¹ Ø§Ù„Ù‡ÙŠÙƒÙ„ Ø³Ø£Ù„Ù‡ Ø§Ù„Ù?Ø±ÙŠØ³ÙŠÙˆÙ† Ø¨Ù…ÙƒØ±ØŒ Ø¨Ø£Ù‰ Ø³Ù„Ø·Ø§Ù† ØªÙ?Ø¹Ù„ Ù‡Ø°Ø§ ÙˆÙ…Ù† Ø£Ø¹Ø·Ø§Ùƒ Ù‡Ø°Ø§ Ø§Ù„Ø³Ù„Ø·Ø§Ù†ØŸ Ù?Ø£Ø¬Ø§Ø¨Ù‡Ù… Ø¹Ù„Ù‰ Ø³Ø¤Ø§Ù„Ù‡Ù… Ù‚Ø§Ø¦Ù„Ø§ Ù„Ù‡Ù… Ø¹Ù† Ù…Ø¹Ù…ÙˆØ¯ÙŠØ© ÙŠÙˆØ­Ù†Ø§ (Ù…Øª 21: 23â€“27)ØŒ (Ù…Ø±11 : 27 â€“33)ØŒ (Ù„Ùˆ20 :1 â€“8)ØŒ Ø«Ù… Ø¶Ø±Ø¨ Ù„Ù‡Ù… Ù…Ø«Ù„ Ø§Ù„Ø¥Ø¨Ù†ÙŠÙ† (Ù…Øª21: 28â€“32)ØŒ ÙˆÙ…Ø«Ù„ Ø§Ù„ÙƒØ±Ø§Ù…ÙŠÙ† Ø§Ù„Ø£Ø´Ø±Ø§Ø± ( Ù…Øª21 : 33-46)ØŒ ÙˆÙ…Ø«Ù„ Ø¹Ø±Ø³ Ø¥Ø¨Ù† Ø§Ù„Ù…Ù„Ùƒ (Ù…Øª22 :1-14)ØŒ ÙˆØ¨Ø¹Ø¯Ø¦Ø° Ø³Ø£Ù„Ù‡ Ø§Ù„Ù?Ø±ÙŠØ³ÙŠÙˆÙ† Ø¹Ù† Ø¬ÙˆØ§Ø² Ø¥Ø¹Ø·Ø§Ø¡ Ø§Ù„Ø¬Ø²ÙŠØ© Ù„Ù‚ÙŠØµØ± (Ù…Øª 22 :15-22)ØŒ ÙƒÙ…Ø§ Ø³Ø£Ù„Ù‡ Ø§Ù„ØµØ¯ÙˆÙ‚ÙŠÙˆÙ† Ø¹Ù† Ø§Ù„Ù‚ÙŠØ§Ù…Ø©ØŒ ÙƒÙ…Ø§ Ø³Ø£Ù„Ù‡ Ù†Ø§Ù…ÙˆØ³ÙŠ Ø¹Ù† Ø§Ù„ÙˆØµÙŠØ© Ø§Ù„Ø¹Ø¸Ù…ÙŠ (Ù…Øª22 : 23-40)ØŒ Ø«Ù… Ø³Ø£Ù„ Ø§Ù„Ø³ÙŠØ¯ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø³ÙŠØ­ Ø§Ù„Ù?Ø±ÙŠØ³ÙŠÙˆÙ† Ø¹Ù† Ø¥Ø¹ØªÙ‚Ø§Ø¯Ù‡Ù… Ù?ÙŠÙ‡ ÙˆØ£Ø¸Ù‡Ø± Ù„Ù‡Ù… Ø±ÙŠØ§Ø¡Ù‡Ù… (Ù…Øª22: 41-46).

He also cautioned them to keep watch (Mt 24:45â€“51), teaching them from the parables of the ten virgins and of the ten talentsâ€”all this was on Mount Olivet (Mt 25:1â€“30).         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            ÙˆÙ„Ù…Ø§ ØµØ¹Ø¯ Ø¥Ù„Ù‰ Ø¬Ø¨Ù„ Ø§Ù„Ø²ÙŠØªÙˆÙ† Ø¬Ù„Ø³ Ù‡Ù†Ø§Ùƒ ÙˆØ¥Ø¨ØªØ¯Ø£ ÙŠØ´Ø±Ø­ Ù„Ø¨Ø·Ø±Ø³ ÙˆÙŠØ¹Ù‚ÙˆØ¨ ÙˆÙŠÙˆØ­Ù†Ø§ ÙˆØ§Ù†Ø¯Ø±Ø§ÙˆØ³ ØªØ±ØªÙŠØ¨ Ø§Ù„Ø£Ø­Ø¯Ø§Ø« ÙˆØ¹Ù„Ø§Ù…Ø§Øª Ù…Ø¬ÙŠØ¦Ù‡ØŒ ÙˆØ®Ø±Ø§Ø¨ Ø£ÙˆØ±Ø´Ù„ÙŠÙ…ØŒ ÙˆÙ†Ù‡Ø§ÙŠØ© Ø§Ù„Ø§Ù…Ø© Ø§Ù„ÙŠÙ‡ÙˆØ¯ÙŠØ©ØŒ ÙˆØ²ÙˆØ§Ù„ Ù†Ø¸Ø§Ù…Ù‡Ø§ (Ù…Øª24: 15-44)ØŒ (Ù…Ø±13: 1-23)ØŒ ÙˆÙ…Ø¬ÙŠØ¦Ù‡ Ø§Ù„Ø£Ø®ÙŠØ± Ù?Ù‰ ÙŠÙˆÙ… Ø§Ù„Ø¯ÙŠÙ†ÙˆÙ†Ø©ØŒ ÙˆØ§Ù„Ø­Ø« Ø¹Ù„ÙŠ Ø§Ù„Ø³Ù‡Ø± (Ù…Øª24: 45-51)ØŒ ÙˆÙ…Ø«Ù„ Ø§Ù„Ø¹Ø´Ø± Ø¹Ø°Ø§Ø±Ù‰ØŒ ÙˆÙ…Ø«Ù„ Ø§Ù„ÙˆØ²Ù†Ø§ØªØŒ ÙˆÙƒØ§Ù† Ø°Ù„Ùƒ Ø¹Ù„Ù‰ Ø¬Ø¨Ù„ Ø§Ù„Ø²ÙŠØªÙˆÙ† (Ù…Øª25: 1-30).         </Language>      </Text>            <Text>         <Language id="English">            When He had finished saying these things, He told His disciples that after two days would be the feast, and the Son of Man would be delivered up to be crucified (Mt 25:31â€“46).

Solomon built the first temple in 1005 BC â€œon the second day of the second month in the fourth year of his reignâ€¦ at Jerusalemâ€™s Mount Moriah, where the Lord had appeared to his father David, at the place that David had prepared on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusiteâ€? (2 Chr 3:2,1). There, he built a high wall, from the heart of the Valley of Jehoshaphat to the peak of the mountain, and filled the expanse between the dome and the wall with earth and stones.[4] Josephus the historian says that some of those stones were 45 feet high, six feet wide, and five feet deep,[5] and that the biggest stones were on the eastern side.[6] Solomon decorated all the rooms, floors, corridors, pillars, and gates that he built in the temple, overlaying them with gold and silver; one being of Corinthian brass.[7] Overall, â€œhe decorated the house with precious stones for beauty (2 Chr 3:6). It took seven and half years to build (1 Kg 6:38), using in its construction 183,300 workers: 30,000 Jews (serving in rotations of 10,000 per month), and 153,300 Canaanites (70,000 carried stones, timber, and other materials, while 80,000 were sculptors and carpenters, plus the 3,300 overseers) (1 Kg 5:13â€“17).         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            ÙˆÙŠØ­Ø³Ù?Ù† Ø¨Ù†Ø§ Ø£Ù† Ù†Ù?Ø´ÙŠØ± Ù‡Ù†Ø§ Ù?ÙŠ Ø¹Ø¬Ø§Ù„Ø© ØªØ§Ø±ÙŠØ®ÙŠØ© Ø§Ù„Ù‰ Ø¨Ù†Ø§Ø¡ Ø§Ù„Ù‡ÙŠÙƒÙ„ ÙˆÙ‡Ø¯Ù…Ù‡ØŒ ÙˆÙ‡Ø§ Ù‡Ù‰: Ø¨Ù†Ù‰ "Ø³Ù„ÙŠÙ…Ø§Ù†" Ø§Ù„Ù‡ÙŠÙƒÙ„ Ø§Ù„Ø£ÙˆÙ„ Ø³Ù†Ø© 1005 Ù‚Ø¨Ù„ Ø§Ù„Ù…ÙŠÙ„Ø§Ø¯ Ù?Ù‰ Ø§Ù„ÙŠÙˆÙ… Ø§Ù„Ø«Ø§Ù†ÙŠ Ù…Ù† Ø§Ù„Ø´Ù‡Ø± Ø§Ù„Ø«Ø§Ù†Ù‰ Ù…Ù† Ø§Ù„Ø³Ù†Ø© Ø§Ù„Ø±Ø§Ø¨Ø¹Ø© Ù„Ù…Ù„ÙƒÙ‡ Ù?Ù‰ Ø£ÙˆØ±Ø´Ù„ÙŠÙ…ØŒ Ù?Ù‰ "Ø¬Ø¨Ù„ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø±ÙŠØ§" Ø­ÙŠØ« ØªØ±Ø§Ø¡Ù‰ Ø§Ù„Ø±Ø¨ Ù„Ø¯Ø§ÙˆØ¯ Ø£Ø¨ÙŠÙ‡.

(1 Kg 6:7). The front of the temple was eastward. Behind this was a slightly lower structure flanked by little houses that were entered from the outside.[8] Above them were houses overlaid with gold, which were exclusively reserved for the priests (1 Kg 6:8). Solomonâ€™s Temple stood for 424 years until it was destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar in 584 BC (2 Chr 36:6â€“7). Zerubbabel built the second temple (Ezra 3:2) on the same site of the first temple, 70 years after its destruction. It was inferior to the first temple in decoration and beauty: It did not have the Ark of the Covenant, which had been lost in the captivity, the cloud of glory did not appear in it, there were no Cherubim of glory, Urim or Thumim, or spirit of prophecy, and yet, it did exceed the first temple in glory and honor, because the Lord Christ had entered it (Hag 2:3,9).         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            ÙˆÙƒØ§Ù† Ø§Ù„Ø¹Ù…Ù„ ÙŠØªÙ… Ø¹Ù„ÙŠ Ø¨Ø¹Ø¯ Ù…Ù† Ù…ÙƒØ§Ù† Ø§Ù„Ø¨Ù†Ø§Ø¡ "Ù?Ù„Ù… ÙŠÙ?Ø³Ù…ÙŽØ¹ Ù?Ù‰ Ø§Ù„Ø¨ÙŠØª Ø¹Ù†Ø¯ Ø¨Ù†Ø§Ø¦Ù‡ Ù…Ù†Ø­Øª ÙˆÙ„Ø§ Ù…Ø¹ÙˆÙ„ ÙˆÙ„Ø§ Ø£Ø¯Ø§Ø© Ø­Ø¯ÙŠØ¯" (1Ù…Ù„ 7:6)ØŒ ÙˆÙ‚Ø¯ ÙƒØ§Ù†Øª Ù…Ù‚Ø¯Ù…Ø© Ø§Ù„Ù‡ÙŠÙƒÙ„ Ù†Ø­Ùˆ Ø§Ù„Ø´Ø±Ù‚ØŒ ÙˆÙ…Ù† Ø®Ù„Ù?Ù‡ Ø¨Ù†Ø§Ø¡ ÙŠÙ‚Ù„ Ø¹Ù†Ù‡ Ø§Ø±ØªÙ?Ø§Ø¹Ø§Ù‹.

Herod the Great, however, renovated and repaired it to win the hearts of the Jews. He began this in the 18th year of his reign, in 20 BC. He employed in its renovation about 10,000 skilled builders. His successors continued repairing and remodeling it until the Jewsâ€™ words to Christ were true: â€œIt has taken forty-six years to build this templeâ€? (Jn 2:20).

It is surrounded by porches and on the sides are houses, dwellings of the Levites. In one of those side houses was a synagogue or school for Jewish scholars. In that school sat Jesus when He was twelve years old, amid the scholars, listening to them and asking them questions (Lk 2:46). On those porches, Jesus spoke to the people. On them, the disciples gathered every day after His ascension (Acts 2:46). One of these porches gained more fame than othersâ€”Solomonâ€™s Porch (Acts 3:11). The height of this porch was 700 feet, and this is where the devil tempted Christ to throw Himself down from its peak (Mt 4:6). In that very court were tables for money changers and those who sold doves. It was called the court of the Gentiles because non-Jews were not allowed to venture beyond this point.[9] In Solomonâ€™s Temple, there was no court of the Gentiles; it only had the court of the priests and the great court (2 Chr 4:9).         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            Ø§Ù„Ø¯Ø§Ø± Ø§Ù„Ø§ÙˆÙ„Ù‰: "Ø¯Ø§Ø± Ø§Ù„Ø£Ù…Ù…" ÙˆÙ?ÙŠ Ø§Ù„Ø¬Ø§Ù†Ø¨ Ø§Ù„Ø´Ø±Ù‚Ù‰ Ù…Ù† Ù‡Ø°Ù‡ Ø§Ù„Ø¯Ø§Ø± Ø¨Ø§Ø¨ Ø§Ù„Ù‡ÙŠÙƒÙ„ Ø§Ù„Ø¬Ù…ÙŠÙ„ (Ø£Ø¹3: 2ØŒ 10)ØŒ ÙˆÙŠØ­ÙŠØ· Ø¨Ù‡Ø§ Ø£Ø±ÙˆÙ‚Ù‡ Ø¹Ù„Ù‰ Ø¬ÙˆØ§Ù†Ø¨Ù‡Ø§ ØºØ±Ù?

They came here to offer their sacrifices.[10] Higher than the first court, it is ascended by nine steps.[11] The two courts were separated by a stone partition one cubit high, and a marble pillar near the steps on which was written a warning in both Greek and Latin to the Gentiles stating that anyone venturing inside would die (Eph 2:13â€“14).[12] St. Paul was accused of â€œbringing Greeks into the temple and defiling that holy placeâ€? (Cf. Acts 21:28). Jews engaged in regular worship in this court (Lk 18:10-14; Acts 21:26â€“30), and in its corners were 13 collection boxes for the worshipers to deposit their offerings (Mk 12:41).         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            Ø§Ù„Ø¯Ø§Ø± Ø§Ù„Ø«Ø§Ù†ÙŠØ©: "Ø¯Ø§Ø± Ø§Ù„Ù†Ø³Ø§Ø¡" ÙˆÙ†Ù?Ø³Ø¨Øª Ø§Ù„Ù‰ Ø§Ù„Ù†Ø³Ø§Ø¡ Ù„Ø§ Ù„Ø£Ù†Ù‡Ø§ Ù…Ø®ØªØµØ© Ø¨Ù‡Ù† Ø¨Ù„ Ù„Ø£Ù†Ù‡ Ù„Ù… ÙŠØ³Ù…Ø­ Ù„Ù‡Ù† Ø£Ù† ÙŠØªØ¹Ø¯ÙŠÙ†Ù‡Ø§ Ø§Ù„Ù‰ Ø¯Ø§Ø®Ù„ØŒ Ù?ÙƒÙ† ÙŠØ£ØªÙŠÙ† Ø§Ù„ÙŠÙ‡Ø§ Ù?Ù‚Ø· Ù„ÙŠÙ‚Ø¯Ù…Ù† Ø§Ù„Ù‚Ø±Ø§Ø¨ÙŠÙ†[10].

West of this court is the inner sanctuary, which is higher, ascended by 12 steps,[15] and before it was a court facing east which peaks at 190 feet. At its entrance are two pillars; one is called Jachin and the second Boaz (2 Chr 3:17), which divided the court into two sectors.[16] The first section is the Holy, which is 60 feet in length by 20 feet in width, containing the golden candlestick, the table of showbread, and the altar of incense (2 Chr 3:3; 4:19).[17] The second section is the Holy of Holies, a square, each side of which is 20 cubits (2 Chr 3:8). The partition between it and the Holy was a luxurious veil (Mt 27:51).[18] This temple was demolished during Titusâ€™ siege of Jerusalem after the Advent by 70 years, as predicted by the Lord of glory (Mt 24:2). Emperor Julian tried to rebuild it in 363 AD, but his efforts were in vain. He and the Jews were eager for its reconstruction. When they dug into the foundation, severe explosions occurred and fireballs appeared which destroyed the equipment, producing dust and smoke clouds to the point that the place became dark.

When this was done, and the siege dragged on, the number of Jews who died was greater than those who survived.[21] Some deserted to Titus, who pardoned them.[22] Then the Romans entered the city and into the House of God Almighty, reigned, and possessed it. There was no one to stop them; all the Jews feared the Romans.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            Ù„Ù…Ø§ ÙƒØ§Ù†Øª Ø§Ù„Ø­Ø±Ø¨ Ù‚Ø§Ø¦Ù…Ø© Ø¨ÙŠÙ† Ø§Ù„Ø±ÙˆÙ… ÙˆØ§Ù„ÙŠÙ‡ÙˆØ¯ØŒ Ø£Ù…Ø± ØªÙŠØ·Ø³ Ø£ØµØ­Ø§Ø¨Ù‡ ÙˆÙ…Ù† Ø¬Ø§Ø¡ Ø§Ù„ÙŠÙ‡ Ù…Ù† Ø§Ù„Ø¬Ù…ÙˆØ¹ Ù…Ù† Ø³Ø§Ø¦Ø± Ø§Ù„Ø§Ù…Ù… Ø£Ù† ÙŠØ­ÙŠØ·ÙˆØ§ Ø¨Ù…Ø¯ÙŠÙ†Ù‡ Ø£ÙˆØ±Ø´Ù„ÙŠÙ…[20] ÙˆÙŠØ­Ø§ØµØ±ÙˆÙ‡Ø§ ÙˆÙŠÙ?Ø¶ÙŽÙŠÙ‚ÙˆØ§ Ø¹Ù„Ù‰ Ù…Ù† Ø¨Ù‚ÙŠ Ù…Ù† Ø£Ù‡Ù„Ù‡Ø§ØŒ Ù?ÙŠØ®Ø¶Ø¹ÙˆÙ‡Ù… Ø¨Ø¯ÙˆÙ† Ø£Ù† ÙŠØªØ¹Ø±Ø¶ÙˆØ§ Ù„Ù…Ø­Ø§Ø±Ø¨ØªÙ‡Ù…ØŒ Ù?Ù?Ø¹Ù„ÙˆØ§ ÙƒØ°Ù„Ùƒ.

However, if the temple was burned, the pride of the Jewish nation would also be destroyed and they would not have a reason to fight, for they would be brokenhearted and humiliated. Titus realized this, but still insisted not to burn it until he commanded.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            ÙˆÙƒØ§Ù† ØªÙŠØ·Ø³ Ù‚Ø¯ Ø£ÙˆØµÙ‰ Ø£ØµØ­Ø§Ø¨Ù‡ ÙˆØ£ÙƒØ¯ Ø¹Ù„ÙŠÙ‡Ù… Ø£Ù„Ø§ ÙŠØ­Ø±Ù‚ÙˆØ§ Ø§Ù„Ù‚Ø¯Ø³[23]ØŒ Ù?Ù‚Ø§Ù„ Ù„Ù‡ Ø±Ø¤Ø³Ø§Ø¡ Ø§Ù„Ø±ÙˆÙ… Ø§Ù†Ùƒ Ø¥Ø°Ø§ Ù„Ù… ØªØ­Ø±Ù‚Ù‡ Ù„Ø§ ØªØ³ØªØ·ÙŠØ¹ Ø£Ù† ØªÙ…Ù„Ùƒ Ø§Ù„ÙŠÙ‡ÙˆØ¯ ÙˆÙ„Ø§ Ø£Ù† ØªÙ‚Ù‡Ø±Ù‡Ù… Ù„Ø§Ù†Ù‡Ù… Ù„Ø§ ÙŠÙ?ØªØ±ÙˆÙ† ÙˆÙ„Ø§ ÙŠÙƒÙ?ÙˆÙ† Ø¹Ù† Ø§Ù„Ù‚ØªØ§Ù„ Ù„Ø§Ø¬Ù„Ù‡ Ù…Ø§ Ø¯Ø§Ù… Ø¨Ø§Ù‚ÙŠØ§Ù‹ØŒ Ù?Ø§Ø°Ø§ Ø­Ø±Ù‚ØªÙ‡ Ø°Ù‡Ø¨ Ø¹Ø²Ù…Ù‡Ù… Ùˆ Ù„Ù… ÙŠØ¨Ù‚ Ù„Ù‡Ù… Ù…Ø§ÙŠÙ‚Ø§ØªÙ„ÙˆÙ† Ø¹Ù†Ù‡ Ù?ØªÙ†ÙƒØ³Ø± Ù‚Ù„ÙˆØ¨Ù‡Ù… ÙˆÙŠØ°Ù„ÙˆÙ†.

It was sealed because the Jews had locked it, yet some Romans came to this gate and smelt it to take its silver. While burning it, they found a way into the temple,[24] seized it, erected their idols, and offered sacrifices to Titus their Caesar. In lifting up their idols to praise him and accept him, they began to curse the temple and boast of Roman greatness. When the remaining Jews learned of this, they could not tolerate it, and a crowd of them went out by night to the Romans who had seized the temple and killed them.[25] When the news reached Titus, he went out with his soldiers to the temple and killed those Jews. The rest fled to Mount Zion and dwelt there.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            ÙˆÙƒØ§Ù† Ø§Ù„Ø·Ø±ÙŠÙ‚ Ø¥Ù„Ù‰ Ø§Ù„Ù‚Ø¯Ø³ Ø¹Ù„ÙŠÙ‡ Ø¨Ø§Ø¨ Ø¹Ø¸ÙŠÙ… Ù…ØµÙ?Ø­ Ø¨ØµÙ?Ø§Ø¦Ø­ Ù?Ø¶ÙŠØ©ØŒ ÙˆÙƒØ§Ù† Ù…ØºÙ„Ù‚Ø§Ù‹ Ù„Ø§Ù† Ø§Ù„ÙŠÙ‡ÙˆØ¯ ÙƒØ§Ù†ÙˆØ§ Ù‚Ø¯ Ø£ØºÙ„Ù‚ÙˆÙ‡ Ø¨Ø¥Ø­ÙƒØ§Ù….

When the gates fell, they gave out a great cry, which reached Titus, who came quickly to the Holy of Holies to stop them from burning it. He could not[26] deter them because, in addition to the Romans, many people including other nations were hostile toward the Jews and sought revenge on them. They ignored and overrode Titus, who was shouting at them loudly to stop. It was said that a group of his friends were killed on that day for entering the temple in great wrath, severe anger, and excessive rage. Titus had no control over the situation and could not stop them.[27] It was also said that in his attempt to command obedience, he lost his voice from all the shouting falling on deaf ears.         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            Ø¥Ø¬ØªÙ…Ø¹ Ø§Ù„Ø±ÙˆÙ… Ù?Ù‰ Ø§Ù„ÙŠÙˆÙ… Ø§Ù„ØªØ§Ù„Ù‰ ÙˆØ£Ø­Ø±Ù‚ÙˆØ§ Ø¨Ø§Ø¨ Ù‚Ø¯Ø³ Ø§Ù„Ø§Ù‚Ø¯Ø§Ø³ ÙˆÙƒØ§Ù†Øª ÙƒÙ„Ù‡Ø§ Ù…ØºØ´Ø§Ø© Ø¨ØµÙ?Ø§Ø¦Ø­ Ø§Ù„Ø°Ù‡Ø¨ØŒ Ù?Ù„Ù…Ø§ Ø³Ù‚Ø·Øª Ø§Ù„Ø£Ø¨ÙˆØ§Ø¨ ØµØ±Ø®ÙˆØ§ ØµØ±Ø§Ø®Ø§ÙŽ Ø¹Ø¸ÙŠÙ…Ø§Ù‹ØŒ Ù?Ø¹Ù„Ù… "ØªÙŠØ·Ø³" Ø¨Ø°Ù„Ùƒ Ù?Ø¬Ø§Ø¡ Ù…Ø³Ø±Ø¹Ø§Ù‹ Ø¥Ù„Ù‰ Ù‚Ø¯Ø³ Ø§Ù„Ø§Ù‚Ø¯Ø§Ø³ Ù„ÙŠÙ…Ù†Ø¹Ù‡Ù… Ù…Ù† Ø¥Ø­Ø±Ø§Ù‚Ù‡ Ù?Ù„Ù… ÙŠØªÙ… Ù„Ù‡ Ø°Ù„Ùƒ[26] Ù„Ø£Ù† Ø§Ù„Ù†Ø§Ø³ ÙƒØ«Ø±ÙˆØ§ ÙˆØ¥Ø¬ØªÙ…Ø¹ Ù?ÙŠÙ‡ Ø®Ù„Ù‚ ÙƒØ«ÙŠØ± Ù…Ù† Ø§Ù„Ø±ÙˆÙ… ÙˆØºÙŠØ±Ù‡Ù… Ù…Ù† Ø§Ù„Ø§Ù…Ù… Ø§Ù„ØªÙ‰ ÙƒØ§Ù†Øª ØªÙ?Ø¹Ø§Ø¯Ù‰ Ø§Ù„ÙŠÙ‡ÙˆØ¯ ÙˆØªØ·Ù„Ø¨ Ø§Ù„ØªØ´Ù?Ù‰ Ù…Ù†Ù‡Ù…ØŒ Ù?ØºÙ„Ø¨ÙˆØ§ "ØªÙŠØ·Ø³" Ø¹Ù„Ù‰ Ø±Ø£ÙŠÙ‡ ÙˆÙ‡Ùˆ ÙŠØµØ±Ø® Ø¨Ø£Ø¹Ù„Ù‰ ØµÙˆØªÙ‡ Ù„ÙŠÙ…Ù†Ø¹Ù‡Ù….

When they were overwhelmed from seeing the temple burnt, they said to themselves, â€œAfter the Holy of God has been burned, what reason is there to live and what life can we enjoy?â€? So, they threw themselves into the fire and were all burned.[29] The burning of the temple was on the tenth day of the fifth month, the same day in which the Chaldeans burned the first temple.[30]         </Language>         <Language id="Arabic">            Ø«Ù… Ø§Ø´ØªØ¹Ù„Øª Ø§Ù„Ù†Ø§Ø± Ù?Ù‰ Ø§Ù„Ù‚Ø¯Ø³ ÙˆØ£Ø­Ø±Ù‚ØªÙ‡ Ø¬Ù…ÙŠØ¹Ù‡ØŒ ÙˆØ¥Ø° Ø¹Ù„Ù… Ù…Ù† Ø¨Ù‚Ù‰ Ù…Ù† Ø§Ù„ÙƒÙ‡Ù†Ù‡ Ø¨Ø¯Ø®ÙˆÙ„ Ø§Ù„Ø±ÙˆÙ… Ø¥Ù„Ù‰ Ù‚Ø¯Ø³ Ø§Ù„Ø§Ù‚Ø¯Ø§Ø³ Ù„ÙŠØ­Ø±Ù‚ÙˆÙ‡ØŒ Ø¬Ø§Ø¡ÙˆØ§ Ù…Ø³ØªÙ‚ØªÙ„ÙŠÙ†ØŒ Ù?Ø­Ø§Ø±Ø¨ÙˆØ§ Ø§Ù„Ø±ÙˆÙ… Ø¥Ù„Ù‰ Ø£Ù† Ù„Ù… ØªØ¨Ù‚ Ù„Ù‡Ù… Ø­ÙŠÙ„Ø© ÙˆÙ„Ø§ Ù‚Ø¯Ø±Ø© Ø¹Ù„Ù‰ Ù…Ø­Ø§Ø±Ø¨ØªÙ‡Ù…ØŒ Ù?Ù„Ù…Ø§ ØºÙ?Ù„Ù?Ø¨ÙˆØ§ Ø¹Ù„ÙŠ Ø£Ù…Ø±Ù‡Ù… ÙˆØ±Ø£ÙˆØ§ Ø£Ù† Ø§Ù„Ø¨ÙŠØª Ù‚Ø¯ Ø§Ø­ØªØ±Ù‚ØŒ Ù‚Ø§Ù„ÙˆØ§ Ø¥Ù† Ø¨Ø¹Ø¯ Ø§Ø­ØªØ±Ø§Ù‚ Ù‚Ø¯Ø³ Ø§Ù„Ù„Ù‡ Ù…Ø§Ù„Ù†Ø§ ÙˆÙ„Ù„Ø­ÙŠØ§Ø©ØŒ ÙˆØ£Ù‰ Ø¹ÙŠØ´ ÙŠØ·ÙŠØ¨ Ù„Ù†Ø§ Ø¨Ø¹Ø¯ØŒ Ù?Ø²Ø¬ÙˆØ§ Ø¨Ø£Ù†Ù?Ø³Ù‡Ù… Ù?Ù‰ Ø§Ù„Ù†Ø§Ø± Ù?Ø¥Ø­ØªØ±Ù‚ÙˆØ§ Ø¨Ø£Ø¬Ù…Ø¹Ù‡Ù…[29]ØŒ ÙˆÙƒØ§Ù† Ø­Ø±ÙŠÙ‚ Ø§Ù„Ù‚Ø¯Ø³ Ù?ÙŠ Ø§Ù„ÙŠÙˆÙ… Ø§Ù„Ø¹Ø§Ø´Ø± Ù…Ù† Ø§Ù„Ø´Ù‡Ø± Ø§Ù„Ø®Ø§Ù…Ø³.

Next, the image of a very handsome, extremely gallant, and exceedingly luminous man appeared in the sky over Jerusalem.
