			<verse num="1"> Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, To the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: </verse>
			<verse num="2"> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. </verse>
			<verse num="3"> We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is fitting, because your faith grows exceedingly, and the love of every one of you all abounds toward each other, </verse>
			<verse num="4"> so that we ourselves boast of you among the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that you endure, </verse>
			<verse num="5"> [which is] manifest evidence of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you also suffer; </verse>
			<verse num="6"> since [it is] a righteous thing with God to repay with tribulation those who trouble you, </verse>
			<verse num="7"> and to [give] you who are troubled rest with us when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with His mighty angels, </verse>
			<verse num="8"> in flaming fire taking vengeance on those who do not know God, and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. </verse>
			<verse num="9"> These shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power, </verse>
			<verse num="10"> when He comes, in that Day, to be glorified in His saints and to be admired among all those who believe, because our testimony among you was believed. </verse>
			<verse num="11"> Therefore we also pray always for you that our God would count you worthy of [this] calling, and fulfill all the good pleasure of [His] goodness and the work of faith with power, </verse>
			<verse num="12"> that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and you in Him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ. </verse>
		</chapter>
		<chapter num="2">
			<verse num="1"> Now, brethren, concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him, we ask you, </verse>
			<verse num="2"> not to be soon shaken in mind or troubled, either by spirit or by word or by letter, as if from us, as though the day of Christ had come. </verse>
			<verse num="3"> Let no one deceive you by any means; for [that Day will not come] unless the falling away comes first, and the man of sin is revealed, the son of perdition, </verse>
			<verse num="4"> who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped, so that he sits as God in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God. </verse>
			<verse num="5"> Do you not remember that when I was still with you I told you these things? </verse>
			<verse num="6"> And now you know what is restraining, that he may be revealed in his own time. </verse>
			<verse num="7"> For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work; only He who now restrains [will do so] until He is taken out of the way. </verse>
			<verse num="8"> And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord will consume with the breath of His mouth and destroy with the brightness of His coming. </verse>
			<verse num="9"> The coming of the [lawless one] is according to the working of Satan, with all power, signs, and lying wonders, </verse>
			<verse num="10"> and with all unrighteous deception among those who perish, because they did not receive the love of the truth, that they might be saved. </verse>
			<verse num="11"> And for this reason God will send them strong delusion, that they should believe the lie, </verse>
			<verse num="12"> that they all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness. </verse>
			<verse num="13"> But we are bound to give thanks to God always for you, brethren beloved by the Lord, because God from the beginning chose you for salvation through sanctification by the Spirit and belief in the truth, </verse>
			<verse num="14"> to which He called you by our gospel, for the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. </verse>
			<verse num="15"> Therefore, brethren, stand fast and hold the traditions which you were taught, whether by word or our epistle. </verse>
			<verse num="16"> Now may our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, and our God and Father, who has loved us and given [us] everlasting consolation and good hope by grace, </verse>
			<verse num="17"> comfort your hearts and establish you in every good word and work. </verse>
		</chapter>
		<chapter num="3">
			<verse num="1"> Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may run [swiftly] and be glorified, just as [it is] with you, </verse>
			<verse num="2"> and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men; for not all have faith. </verse>
			<verse num="3"> But the Lord is faithful, who will establish you and guard [you] from the evil one. </verse>
			<verse num="4"> And we have confidence in the Lord concerning you, both that you do and will do the things we command you. </verse>
			<verse num="5"> Now may the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the patience of Christ. </verse>
			<verse num="6"> But we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw from every brother who walks disorderly and not according to the tradition which he received from us. </verse>
			<verse num="7"> For you yourselves know how you ought to follow us, for we were not disorderly among you; </verse>
			<verse num="8"> nor did we eat anyone's bread free of charge, but worked with labor and toil night and day, that we might not be a burden to any of you, </verse>
			<verse num="9"> not because we do not have authority, but to make ourselves an example of how you should follow us. </verse>
			<verse num="10"> For even when we were with you, we commanded you this: If anyone will not work, neither shall he eat. </verse>
			<verse num="11"> For we hear that there are some who walk among you in a disorderly manner, not working at all, but are busybodies. </verse>
			<verse num="12"> Now those who are such we command and exhort through our Lord Jesus Christ that they work in quietness and eat their own bread. </verse>
			<verse num="13"> But [as for] you, brethren, do not grow weary [in] doing good. </verse>
			<verse num="14"> And if anyone does not obey our word in this epistle, note that person and do not keep company with him, that he may be ashamed. </verse>
			<verse num="15"> Yet do not count [him] as an enemy, but admonish [him] as a brother. </verse>
			<verse num="16"> Now may the Lord of peace Himself give you peace always in every way. The Lord [be] with you all. </verse>
			<verse num="17"> The salutation of Paul with my own hand, which is a sign in every epistle; so I write. </verse>
			<verse num="18"> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you all. Amen. </verse>
