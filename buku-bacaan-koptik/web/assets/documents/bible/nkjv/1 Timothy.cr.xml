		<chapter num="1">
			<verse num="1"> Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the commandment of God our Savior and the Lord Jesus Christ, our hope, </verse>
			<verse num="2"> To Timothy, a true son in the faith: Grace, mercy, [and] peace from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord. </verse>
			<verse num="3"> As I urged you when I went into Macedonia -- remain in Ephesus that you may charge some that they teach no other doctrine, </verse>
			<verse num="4"> nor give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which cause disputes rather than godly edification which is in faith. </verse>
			<verse num="5"> Now the purpose of the commandment is love from a pure heart, [from] a good conscience, and [from] sincere faith, </verse>
			<verse num="6"> from which some, having strayed, have turned aside to idle talk, </verse>
			<verse num="7"> desiring to be teachers of the law, understanding neither what they say nor the things which they affirm. </verse>
			<verse num="8"> But we know that the law [is] good if one uses it lawfully, </verse>
			<verse num="9"> knowing this: that the law is not made for a righteous person, but for [the] lawless and insubordinate, for [the] ungodly and for sinners, for [the] unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, </verse>
			<verse num="10"> for fornicators, for sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine, </verse>
			<verse num="11"> according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God which was committed to my trust. </verse>
			<verse num="12"> And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord who has enabled me, because He counted me faithful, putting [me] into the ministry, </verse>
			<verse num="13"> although I was formerly a blasphemer, a persecutor, and an insolent man; but I obtained mercy because I did [it] ignorantly in unbelief. </verse>
			<verse num="14"> And the grace of our Lord was exceedingly abundant, with faith and love which are in Christ Jesus. </verse>
			<verse num="15"> This [is] a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief. </verse>
			<verse num="16"> However, for this reason I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might show all longsuffering, as a pattern to those who are going to believe on Him for everlasting life. </verse>
			<verse num="17"> Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, to God who alone is wise, [be] honor and glory forever and ever. Amen. </verse>
			<verse num="18"> This charge I commit to you, son Timothy, according to the prophecies previously made concerning you, that by them you may wage the good warfare, </verse>
			<verse num="19"> having faith and a good conscience, which some having rejected, concerning the faith have suffered shipwreck, </verse>
			<verse num="20"> of whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I delivered to Satan that they may learn not to blaspheme. </verse>
		</chapter>
		<chapter num="2">
			<verse num="1"> Therefore I exhort first of all that supplications, prayers, intercessions, [and] giving of thanks be made for all men, </verse>
			<verse num="2"> for kings and all who are in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and reverence. </verse>
			<verse num="3"> For this [is] good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, </verse>
			<verse num="4"> who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth. </verse>
			<verse num="5"> For [there is] one God and one Mediator between God and men, [the] Man Christ Jesus, </verse>
			<verse num="6"> who gave Himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time, </verse>
			<verse num="7"> for which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle -- I am speaking the truth in Christ [and] not lying -- a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth. </verse>
			<verse num="8"> I desire therefore that the men pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting; </verse>
			<verse num="9"> in like manner also, that the women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with propriety and moderation, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or costly clothing, </verse>
			<verse num="10"> but, which is proper for women professing godliness, with good works. </verse>
			<verse num="11"> Let a woman learn in silence with all submission. </verse>
			<verse num="12"> And I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man, but to be in silence. </verse>
			<verse num="13"> For Adam was formed first, then Eve. </verse>
			<verse num="14"> And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived, fell into transgression. </verse>
			<verse num="15"> Nevertheless she will be saved in childbearing if they continue in faith, love, and holiness, with self-control. </verse>
		</chapter>
		<chapter num="3">
			<verse num="1"> This [is] a faithful saying: If a man desires the position of a bishop, he desires a good work. </verse>
			<verse num="2"> A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, temperate, sober-minded, of good behavior, hospitable, able to teach; </verse>
			<verse num="3"> not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for money, but gentle, not quarrelsome, not covetous; </verse>
			<verse num="4"> one who rules his own house well, having [his] children in submission with all reverence </verse>
			<verse num="5"> (for if a man does not know how to rule his own house, how will he take care of the church of God?); </verse>
			<verse num="6"> not a novice, lest being puffed up with pride he fall into the [same] condemnation as the devil. </verse>
			<verse num="7"> Moreover he must have a good testimony among those who are outside, lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil. </verse>
			<verse num="8"> Likewise deacons [must be] reverent, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy for money, </verse>
			<verse num="9"> holding the mystery of the faith with a pure conscience. </verse>
			<verse num="10"> But let these also first be tested; then let them serve as deacons, being [found] blameless. </verse>
			<verse num="11"> Likewise [their] wives [must be] reverent, not slanderers, temperate, faithful in all things. </verse>
			<verse num="12"> Let deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling [their] children and their own houses well. </verse>
			<verse num="13"> For those who have served well as deacons obtain for themselves a good standing and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus. </verse>
			<verse num="14"> These things I write to you, though I hope to come to you shortly; </verse>
			<verse num="15"> but if I am delayed, [I write] so that you may know how you ought to conduct yourself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth. </verse>
			<verse num="16"> And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifested in the flesh, Justified in the Spirit, Seen by angels, Preached among the Gentiles, Believed on in the world, Received up in glory. </verse>
		</chapter>
		<chapter num="4">
			<verse num="1"> Now the Spirit expressly says that in latter times some will depart from the faith, giving heed to deceiving spirits and doctrines of demons, </verse>
			<verse num="2"> speaking lies in hypocrisy, having their own conscience seared with a hot iron, </verse>
			<verse num="3"> forbidding to marry, [and commanding] to abstain from foods which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth. </verse>
			<verse num="4"> For every creature of God [is] good, and nothing is to be refused if it is received with thanksgiving; </verse>
			<verse num="5"> for it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer. </verse>
			<verse num="6"> If you instruct the brethren in these things, you will be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished in the words of faith and of the good doctrine which you have carefully followed. </verse>
			<verse num="7"> But reject profane and old wives' fables, and exercise yourself toward godliness. </verse>
			<verse num="8"> For bodily exercise profits a little, but godliness is profitable for all things, having promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come. </verse>
			<verse num="9"> This [is] a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptance. </verse>
			<verse num="10"> For to this [end] we both labor and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is [the] Savior of all men, especially of those who believe. </verse>
			<verse num="11"> These things command and teach. </verse>
			<verse num="12"> Let no one despise your youth, but be an example to the believers in word, in conduct, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity. </verse>
			<verse num="13"> Till I come, give attention to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine. </verse>
			<verse num="14"> Do not neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you by prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the eldership. </verse>
			<verse num="15"> Meditate on these things; give yourself entirely to them, that your progress may be evident to all. </verse>
			<verse num="16"> Take heed to yourself and to the doctrine. Continue in them, for in doing this you will save both yourself and those who hear you. </verse>
		</chapter>
		<chapter num="5">
			<verse num="1"> Do not rebuke an older man, but exhort [him] as a father, younger men as brothers, </verse>
			<verse num="2"> older women as mothers, younger as sisters, with all purity. </verse>
			<verse num="3"> Honor widows who are really widows. </verse>
			<verse num="4"> But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them first learn to show piety at home and to repay their parents; for this is good and acceptable before God. </verse>
			<verse num="5"> Now she who is really a widow, and left alone, trusts in God and continues in supplications and prayers night and day. </verse>
			<verse num="6"> But she who lives in pleasure is dead while she lives. </verse>
			<verse num="7"> And these things command, that they may be blameless. </verse>
			<verse num="8"> But if anyone does not provide for his own, and especially for those of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever. </verse>
			<verse num="9"> Do not let a widow under sixty years old be taken into the number, [and not unless] she has been the wife of one man, </verse>
			<verse num="10"> well reported for good works: if she has brought up children, if she has lodged strangers, if she has washed the saints' feet, if she has relieved the afflicted, if she has diligently followed every good work. </verse>
			<verse num="11"> But refuse [the] younger widows; for when they have begun to grow wanton against Christ, they desire to marry, </verse>
			<verse num="12"> having condemnation because they have cast off their first faith. </verse>
			<verse num="13"> And besides they learn [to be] idle, wandering about from house to house, and not only idle but also gossips and busybodies, saying things which they ought not. </verse>
			<verse num="14"> Therefore I desire that [the] younger [widows] marry, bear children, manage the house, give no opportunity to the adversary to speak reproachfully. </verse>
			<verse num="15"> For some have already turned aside after Satan. </verse>
			<verse num="16"> If any believing man or woman has widows, let them relieve them, and do not let the church be burdened, that it may relieve those who are really widows. </verse>
			<verse num="17"> Let the elders who rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in the word and doctrine. </verse>
			<verse num="18"> For the Scripture says, "You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain," and, "The laborer [is] worthy of his wages." </verse>
			<verse num="19"> Do not receive an accusation against an elder except from two or three witnesses. </verse>
			<verse num="20"> Those who are sinning rebuke in the presence of all, that the rest also may fear. </verse>
			<verse num="21"> I charge [you] before God and the Lord Jesus Christ and the elect angels that you observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing with partiality. </verse>
			<verse num="22"> Do not lay hands on anyone hastily, nor share in other people's sins; keep yourself pure. </verse>
			<verse num="23"> No longer drink only water, but use a little wine for your stomach's sake and your frequent infirmities. </verse>
			<verse num="24"> Some men's sins are clearly evident, preceding [them] to judgment, but those of some [men] follow later. </verse>
			<verse num="25"> Likewise, the good works [of some] are clearly evident, and those that are otherwise cannot be hidden. </verse>
		</chapter>
		<chapter num="6">
			<verse num="1"> Let as many bondservants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor, so that the name of God and [His] doctrine may not be blasphemed. </verse>
			<verse num="2"> And those who have believing masters, let them not despise [them] because they are brethren, but rather serve [them] because those who are benefited are believers and beloved. Teach and exhort these things. </verse>
			<verse num="3"> If anyone teaches otherwise and does not consent to wholesome words, [even] the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which accords with godliness, </verse>
			<verse num="4"> he is proud, knowing nothing, but is obsessed with disputes and arguments over words, from which come envy, strife, reviling, evil suspicions, </verse>
			<verse num="5"> useless wranglings of men of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth, who suppose that godliness is a [means of] gain. From such withdraw yourself. </verse>
			<verse num="6"> Now godliness with contentment is great gain. </verse>
			<verse num="7"> For we brought nothing into [this] world, [and it is] certain we can carry nothing out. </verse>
			<verse num="8"> And having food and clothing, with these we shall be content. </verse>
			<verse num="9"> But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and [into] many foolish and harmful lusts which drown men in destruction and perdition. </verse>
			<verse num="10"> For the love of money is a root of all [kinds of] evil, for which some have strayed from the faith in their greediness, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows. </verse>
			<verse num="11"> But you, O man of God, flee these things and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, gentleness. </verse>
			<verse num="12"> Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, to which you were also called and have confessed the good confession in the presence of many witnesses. </verse>
			<verse num="13"> I urge you in the sight of God who gives life to all things, and [before] Christ Jesus who witnessed the good confession before Pontius Pilate, </verse>
			<verse num="14"> that you keep [this] commandment without spot, blameless until our Lord Jesus Christ's appearing, </verse>
			<verse num="15"> which He will manifest in His own time, [He who is] the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings and Lord of lords, </verse>
			<verse num="16"> who alone has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen or can see, to whom [be] honor and everlasting power. Amen. </verse>
			<verse num="17"> Command those who are rich in this present age not to be haughty, nor to trust in uncertain riches but in the living God, who gives us richly all things to enjoy. </verse>
			<verse num="18"> [Let them] do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to give, willing to share, </verse>
			<verse num="19"> storing up for themselves a good foundation for the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life. </verse>
			<verse num="20"> O Timothy! Guard what was committed to your trust, avoiding the profane [and] idle babblings and contradictions of what is falsely called knowledge -- </verse>
			<verse num="21"> by professing it some have strayed concerning the faith. Grace [be] with you. Amen. </verse>
