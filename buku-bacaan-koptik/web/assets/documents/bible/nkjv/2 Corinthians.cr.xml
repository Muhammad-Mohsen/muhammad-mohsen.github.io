		<chapter num="1">
			<verse num="1"> Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy [our] brother, To the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints who are in all Achaia: </verse>
			<verse num="2"> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. </verse>
			<verse num="3"> Blessed [be] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort, </verse>
			<verse num="4"> who comforts us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort those who are in any trouble, with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God. </verse>
			<verse num="5"> For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also abounds through Christ. </verse>
			<verse num="6"> Now if we are afflicted, [it is] for your consolation and salvation, which is effective for enduring the same sufferings which we also suffer. Or if we are comforted, [it is] for your consolation and salvation. </verse>
			<verse num="7"> And our hope for you [is] steadfast, because we know that as you are partakers of the sufferings, so also [you will partake] of the consolation. </verse>
			<verse num="8"> For we do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, of our trouble which came to us in Asia: that we were burdened beyond measure, above strength, so that we despaired even of life. </verse>
			<verse num="9"> Yes, we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves but in God who raises the dead, </verse>
			<verse num="10"> who delivered us from so great a death, and does deliver us; in whom we trust that He will still deliver [us,] </verse>
			<verse num="11"> you also helping together in prayer for us, that thanks may be given by many persons on our behalf for the gift [granted] to us through many. </verse>
			<verse num="12"> For our boasting is this: the testimony of our conscience that we conducted ourselves in the world in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom but by the grace of God, and more abundantly toward you. </verse>
			<verse num="13"> For we are not writing any other things to you than what you read or understand. Now I trust you will understand, even to the end </verse>
			<verse num="14"> (as also you have understood us in part), that we are your boast as you also [are] ours, in the day of the Lord Jesus. </verse>
			<verse num="15"> And in this confidence I intended to come to you before, that you might have a second benefit -- </verse>
			<verse num="16"> to pass by way of you to Macedonia, to come again from Macedonia to you, and be helped by you on my way to Judea. </verse>
			<verse num="17"> Therefore, when I was planning this, did I do it lightly? Or the things I plan, do I plan according to the flesh, that with me there should be Yes, Yes, and No, No? </verse>
			<verse num="18"> But [as] God [is] faithful, our word to you was not Yes and No. </verse>
			<verse num="19"> For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us -- by me, Silvanus, and Timothy -- was not Yes and No, but in Him was Yes. </verse>
			<verse num="20"> For all the promises of God in Him [are] Yes, and in Him Amen, to the glory of God through us. </verse>
			<verse num="21"> Now He who establishes us with you in Christ and has anointed us [is] God, </verse>
			<verse num="22"> who also has sealed us and given us the Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee. </verse>
			<verse num="23"> Moreover I call God as witness against my soul, that to spare you I came no more to Corinth. </verse>
			<verse num="24"> Not that we have dominion over your faith, but are fellow workers for your joy; for by faith you stand. </verse>
		</chapter>
		<chapter num="2">
			<verse num="1"> But I determined this within myself, that I would not come again to you in sorrow. </verse>
			<verse num="2"> For if I make you sorrowful, then who is he who makes me glad but the one who is made sorrowful by me? </verse>
			<verse num="3"> And I wrote this very thing to you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow over those from whom I ought to have joy, having confidence in you all that my joy is [the joy] of you all. </verse>
			<verse num="4"> For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you, with many tears, not that you should be grieved, but that you might know the love which I have so abundantly for you. </verse>
			<verse num="5"> But if anyone has caused grief, he has not grieved me, but all of you to some extent -- not to be too severe. </verse>
			<verse num="6"> This punishment which [was inflicted] by the majority [is] sufficient for such a man, </verse>
			<verse num="7"> so that, on the contrary, you [ought] rather to forgive and comfort [him,] lest perhaps such a one be swallowed up with too much sorrow. </verse>
			<verse num="8"> Therefore I urge you to reaffirm [your] love to him. </verse>
			<verse num="9"> For to this end I also wrote, that I might put you to the test, whether you are obedient in all things. </verse>
			<verse num="10"> Now whom you forgive anything, I also [forgive.] For if indeed I have forgiven anything, I have forgiven that one for your sakes in the presence of Christ, </verse>
			<verse num="11"> lest Satan should take advantage of us; for we are not ignorant of his devices. </verse>
			<verse num="12"> Furthermore, when I came to Troas to [preach] Christ's gospel, and a door was opened to me by the Lord, </verse>
			<verse num="13"> I had no rest in my spirit, because I did not find Titus my brother; but taking my leave of them, I departed for Macedonia. </verse>
			<verse num="14"> Now thanks [be] to God who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and through us diffuses the fragrance of His knowledge in every place. </verse>
			<verse num="15"> For we are to God the fragrance of Christ among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing. </verse>
			<verse num="16"> To the one [we are] the aroma of death [leading] to death, and to the other the aroma of life [leading] to life. And who [is] sufficient for these things? </verse>
			<verse num="17"> For we are not, as so many, peddling the word of God; but as of sincerity, but as from God, we speak in the sight of God in Christ. </verse>
		</chapter>
		<chapter num="3">
			<verse num="1"> Do we begin again to commend ourselves? Or do we need, as some [others,] epistles of commendation to you or [letters] of commendation from you? </verse>
			<verse num="2"> You are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read by all men; </verse>
			<verse num="3"> clearly [you are] an epistle of Christ, ministered by us, written not with ink but by the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of flesh, [that is,] of the heart. </verse>
			<verse num="4"> And we have such trust through Christ toward God. </verse>
			<verse num="5"> Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think of anything as [being] from ourselves, but our sufficiency [is] from God, </verse>
			<verse num="6"> who also made us sufficient as ministers of the new covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life. </verse>
			<verse num="7"> But if the ministry of death, written [and] engraved on stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not look steadily at the face of Moses because of the glory of his countenance, which [glory] was passing away, </verse>
			<verse num="8"> how will the ministry of the Spirit not be more glorious? </verse>
			<verse num="9"> For if the ministry of condemnation [had] glory, the ministry of righteousness exceeds much more in glory. </verse>
			<verse num="10"> For even what was made glorious had no glory in this respect, because of the glory that excels. </verse>
			<verse num="11"> For if what is passing away [was] glorious, what remains [is] much more glorious. </verse>
			<verse num="12"> Therefore, since we have such hope, we use great boldness of speech -- </verse>
			<verse num="13"> unlike Moses, [who] put a veil over his face so that the children of Israel could not look steadily at the end of what was passing away. </verse>
			<verse num="14"> But their minds were blinded. For until this day the same veil remains unlifted in the reading of the Old Testament, because the [veil] is taken away in Christ. </verse>
			<verse num="15"> But even to this day, when Moses is read, a veil lies on their heart. </verse>
			<verse num="16"> Nevertheless when one turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away. </verse>
			<verse num="17"> Now the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord [is,] there [is] liberty. </verse>
			<verse num="18"> But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as by the Spirit of the Lord. </verse>
		</chapter>
		<chapter num="4">
			<verse num="1"> Therefore, since we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we do not lose heart. </verse>
			<verse num="2"> But we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness nor handling the word of God deceitfully, but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God. </verse>
			<verse num="3"> But even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing, </verse>
			<verse num="4"> whose minds the god of this age has blinded, who do not believe, lest the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine on them. </verse>
			<verse num="5"> For we do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord, and ourselves your bondservants for Jesus' sake. </verse>
			<verse num="6"> For it is the God who commanded light to shine out of darkness, who has shone in our hearts to [give] the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. </verse>
			<verse num="7"> But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us. </verse>
			<verse num="8"> [We are] hard pressed on every side, yet not crushed; [we are] perplexed, but not in despair; </verse>
			<verse num="9"> persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed -- </verse>
			<verse num="10"> always carrying about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body. </verse>
			<verse num="11"> For we who live are always delivered to death for Jesus' sake, that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh. </verse>
			<verse num="12"> So then death is working in us, but life in you. </verse>
			<verse num="13"> And since we have the same spirit of faith, according to what is written, "I believed and therefore I spoke," we also believe and therefore speak, </verse>
			<verse num="14"> knowing that He who raised up the Lord Jesus will also raise us up with Jesus, and will present [us] with you. </verse>
			<verse num="15"> For all things [are] for your sakes, that grace, having spread through the many, may cause thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God. </verse>
			<verse num="16"> Therefore we do not lose heart. Even though our outward man is perishing, yet the inward [man] is being renewed day by day. </verse>
			<verse num="17"> For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, is working for us a far more exceeding [and] eternal weight of glory, </verse>
			<verse num="18"> while we do not look at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen [are] temporary, but the things which are not seen [are] eternal. </verse>
		</chapter>
		<chapter num="5">
			<verse num="1"> For we know that if our earthly house, [this] tent, is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. </verse>
			<verse num="2"> For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed with our habitation which is from heaven, </verse>
			<verse num="3"> if indeed, having been clothed, we shall not be found naked. </verse>
			<verse num="4"> For we who are in [this] tent groan, being burdened, not because we want to be unclothed, but further clothed, that mortality may be swallowed up by life. </verse>
			<verse num="5"> Now He who has prepared us for this very thing [is] God, who also has given us the Spirit as a guarantee. </verse>
			<verse num="6"> So [we are] always confident, knowing that while we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord. </verse>
			<verse num="7"> For we walk by faith, not by sight. </verse>
			<verse num="8"> We are confident, yes, well pleased rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord. </verse>
			<verse num="9"> Therefore we make it our aim, whether present or absent, to be well pleasing to Him. </verse>
			<verse num="10"> For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things [done] in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad. </verse>
			<verse num="11"> Knowing, therefore, the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are well known to God, and I also trust are well known in your consciences. </verse>
			<verse num="12"> For we do not commend ourselves again to you, but give you opportunity to boast on our behalf, that you may have [an answer] for those who boast in appearance and not in heart. </verse>
			<verse num="13"> For if we are beside ourselves, [it is] for God; or if we are of sound mind, [it is] for you. </verse>
			<verse num="14"> For the love of Christ compels us, because we judge thus: that if One died for all, then all died; </verse>
			<verse num="15"> and He died for all, that those who live should live no longer for themselves, but for Him who died for them and rose again. </verse>
			<verse num="16"> Therefore, from now on, we regard no one according to the flesh. Even though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know [Him thus] no longer. </verse>
			<verse num="17"> Therefore, if anyone [is] in Christ, [he is] a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new. </verse>
			<verse num="18"> Now all things [are] of God, who has reconciled us to Himself through Jesus Christ, and has given us the ministry of reconciliation, </verse>
			<verse num="19"> that is, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not imputing their trespasses to them, and has committed to us the word of reconciliation. </verse>
			<verse num="20"> Now then, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were pleading through us: we implore [you] on Christ's behalf, be reconciled to God. </verse>
			<verse num="21"> For He made Him who knew no sin [to be] sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him. </verse>
		</chapter>
		<chapter num="6">
			<verse num="1"> We then, [as] workers together [with Him] also plead with [you] not to receive the grace of God in vain. </verse>
			<verse num="2"> For He says: "In an acceptable time I have heard you, And in the day of salvation I have helped you." Behold, now [is] the accepted time; behold, now [is] the day of salvation. </verse>
			<verse num="3"> We give no offense in anything, that our ministry may not be blamed. </verse>
			<verse num="4"> But in all [things] we commend ourselves as ministers of God: in much patience, in tribulations, in needs, in distresses, </verse>
			<verse num="5"> in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in sleeplessness, in fastings; </verse>
			<verse num="6"> by purity, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Spirit, by sincere love, </verse>
			<verse num="7"> by the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left, </verse>
			<verse num="8"> by honor and dishonor, by evil report and good report; as deceivers, and [yet] true; </verse>
			<verse num="9"> as unknown, and [yet] well known; as dying, and behold we live; as chastened, and [yet] not killed; </verse>
			<verse num="10"> as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and [yet] possessing all things. </verse>
			<verse num="11"> O Corinthians! We have spoken openly to you, our heart is wide open. </verse>
			<verse num="12"> You are not restricted by us, but you are restricted by your [own] affections. </verse>
			<verse num="13"> Now in return for the same (I speak as to children), you also be open. </verse>
			<verse num="14"> Do not be unequally yoked together with unbelievers. For what fellowship has righteousness with lawlessness? And what communion has light with darkness? </verse>
			<verse num="15"> And what accord has Christ with Belial? Or what part has a believer with an unbeliever? </verse>
			<verse num="16"> And what agreement has the temple of God with idols? For you are the temple of the living God. As God has said: "I will dwell in them And walk among [them.] I will be their God, And they shall be My people." </verse>
			<verse num="17"> Therefore "Come out from among them And be separate, says the Lord. Do not touch what is unclean, And I will receive you." </verse>
			<verse num="18"> "I will be a Father to you, And you shall be My sons and daughters, Says the LORD Almighty." </verse>
		</chapter>
		<chapter num="7">
			<verse num="1"> Therefore, having these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God. </verse>
			<verse num="2"> Open [your hearts] to us. We have wronged no one, we have corrupted no one, we have cheated no one. </verse>
			<verse num="3"> I do not say [this] to condemn; for I have said before that you are in our hearts, to die together and to live together. </verse>
			<verse num="4"> Great [is] my boldness of speech toward you, great [is] my boasting on your behalf. I am filled with comfort. I am exceedingly joyful in all our tribulation. </verse>
			<verse num="5"> For indeed, when we came to Macedonia, our bodies had no rest, but we were troubled on every side. Outside [were] conflicts, inside [were] fears. </verse>
			<verse num="6"> Nevertheless God, who comforts the downcast, comforted us by the coming of Titus, </verse>
			<verse num="7"> and not only by his coming, but also by the consolation with which he was comforted in you, when he told us of your earnest desire, your mourning, your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced even more. </verse>
			<verse num="8"> For even if I made you sorry with my letter, I do not regret it; though I did regret it. For I perceive that the same epistle made you sorry, though only for a while. </verse>
			<verse num="9"> Now I rejoice, not that you were made sorry, but that your sorrow led to repentance. For you were made sorry in a godly manner, that you might suffer loss from us in nothing. </verse>
			<verse num="10"> For godly sorrow produces repentance [leading] to salvation, not to be regretted; but the sorrow of the world produces death. </verse>
			<verse num="11"> For observe this very thing, that you sorrowed in a godly manner: What diligence it produced in you, [what] clearing [of yourselves, what] indignation, [what] fear, [what] vehement desire, [what] zeal, [what] vindication! In all [things] you proved yourselves to be clear in this matter. </verse>
			<verse num="12"> Therefore, although I wrote to you, [I did] not [do it] for the sake of him who had done the wrong, nor for the sake of him who suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear to you. </verse>
			<verse num="13"> Therefore we have been comforted in your comfort. And we rejoiced exceedingly more for the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by you all. </verse>
			<verse num="14"> For if in anything I have boasted to him about you, I am not ashamed. But as we spoke all things to you in truth, even so our boasting to Titus was found true. </verse>
			<verse num="15"> And his affections are greater for you as he remembers the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling you received him. </verse>
			<verse num="16"> Therefore I rejoice that I have confidence in you in everything. </verse>
		</chapter>
		<chapter num="8">
			<verse num="1"> Moreover, brethren, we make known to you the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia: </verse>
			<verse num="2"> that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded in the riches of their liberality. </verse>
			<verse num="3"> For I bear witness that according to [their] ability, yes, and beyond [their] ability, [they were] freely willing, </verse>
			<verse num="4"> imploring us with much urgency that we would receive the gift and the fellowship of the ministering to the saints. </verse>
			<verse num="5"> And not [only] as we had hoped, but they first gave themselves to the Lord, and [then] to us by the will of God. </verse>
			<verse num="6"> So we urged Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also complete this grace in you as well. </verse>
			<verse num="7"> But as you abound in everything -- in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in all diligence, and in your love for us -- [see] that you abound in this grace also. </verse>
			<verse num="8"> I speak not by commandment, but I am testing the sincerity of your love by the diligence of others. </verse>
			<verse num="9"> For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, that you through His poverty might become rich. </verse>
			<verse num="10"> And in this I give advice: It is to your advantage not only to be doing what you began and were desiring to do a year ago; </verse>
			<verse num="11"> but now you also must complete the doing [of it;] that as [there was] a readiness to desire [it,] so [there] also [may be] a completion out of what [you] have. </verse>
			<verse num="12"> For if there is first a willing mind, [it is] accepted according to what one has, [and] not according to what he does not have. </verse>
			<verse num="13"> For [I do] not [mean] that others should be eased and you burdened; </verse>
			<verse num="14"> but by an equality, [that] now at this time your abundance [may supply] their lack, that their abundance also may supply your lack -- that there may be equality. </verse>
			<verse num="15"> As it is written, "He who [gathered] much had nothing left over, and he who [gathered] little had no lack." </verse>
			<verse num="16"> But thanks [be] to God who puts the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus. </verse>
			<verse num="17"> For he not only accepted the exhortation, but being more diligent, he went to you of his own accord. </verse>
			<verse num="18"> And we have sent with him the brother whose praise [is] in the gospel throughout all the churches, </verse>
			<verse num="19"> and not only [that,] but who was also chosen by the churches to travel with us with this gift, which is administered by us to the glory of the Lord Himself and [to show] your ready mind, </verse>
			<verse num="20"> avoiding this: that anyone should blame us in this lavish gift which is administered by us -- </verse>
			<verse num="21"> providing honorable things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men. </verse>
			<verse num="22"> And we have sent with them our brother whom we have often proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, because of the great confidence which [we have] in you. </verse>
			<verse num="23"> If [anyone inquires] about Titus, [he is] my partner and fellow worker concerning you. Or if our brethren [are inquired about, they are] messengers of the churches, the glory of Christ. </verse>
			<verse num="24"> Therefore show to them, and before the churches the proof of your love and of our boasting on your behalf. </verse>
		</chapter>
		<chapter num="9">
			<verse num="1"> Now concerning the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you; </verse>
			<verse num="2"> for I know your willingness, about which I boast of you to the Macedonians, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal has stirred up the majority. </verse>
			<verse num="3"> Yet I have sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this respect, that, as I said, you may be ready; </verse>
			<verse num="4"> lest if [some] Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we (not to mention you!) should be ashamed of this confident boasting. </verse>
			<verse num="5"> Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren to go to you ahead of time, and prepare your generous gift beforehand, which [you had] previously promised, that it may be ready as [a matter of] generosity and not as a grudging obligation. </verse>
			<verse num="6"> But this [I say:] He who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. </verse>
			<verse num="7"> [So let] each one [give] as he purposes in his heart, not grudgingly or of necessity; for God loves a cheerful giver. </verse>
			<verse num="8"> And God [is] able to make all grace abound toward you, that you, always having all sufficiency in all [things,] may have an abundance for every good work. </verse>
			<verse num="9"> As it is written: "He has dispersed abroad, He has given to the poor; His righteousness endures forever." </verse>
			<verse num="10"> Now may He who supplies seed to the sower, and bread for food, supply and multiply the seed you have [sown] and increase the fruits of your righteousness, </verse>
			<verse num="11"> while [you are] enriched in everything for all liberality, which causes thanksgiving through us to God. </verse>
			<verse num="12"> For the administration of this service not only supplies the needs of the saints, but also is abounding through many thanksgivings to God, </verse>
			<verse num="13"> while, through the proof of this ministry, they glorify God for the obedience of your confession to the gospel of Christ, and for [your] liberal sharing with them and all [men,] </verse>
			<verse num="14"> and by their prayer for you, who long for you because of the exceeding grace of God in you. </verse>
			<verse num="15"> Thanks [be] to God for His indescribable gift! </verse>
		</chapter>
		<chapter num="10">
			<verse num="1"> Now I, Paul, myself am pleading with you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ -- who in presence [am] lowly among you, but being absent am bold toward you. </verse>
			<verse num="2"> But I beg [you] that when I am present I may not be bold with that confidence by which I intend to be bold against some, who think of us as if we walked according to the flesh. </verse>
			<verse num="3"> For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh. </verse>
			<verse num="4"> For the weapons of our warfare [are] not carnal but mighty in God for pulling down strongholds, </verse>
			<verse num="5"> casting down arguments and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ, </verse>
			<verse num="6"> and being ready to punish all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled. </verse>
			<verse num="7"> Do you look at things according to the outward appearance? If anyone is convinced in himself that he is Christ's, let him again consider this in himself, that just as he [is] Christ's, even so we [are] Christ's. </verse>
			<verse num="8"> For even if I should boast somewhat more about our authority, which the Lord gave us for edification and not for your destruction, I shall not be ashamed -- </verse>
			<verse num="9"> lest I seem to terrify you by letters. </verse>
			<verse num="10"> "For [his] letters," they say, "[are] weighty and powerful, but [his] bodily presence [is] weak, and [his] speech contemptible." </verse>
			<verse num="11"> Let such a person consider this, that what we are in word by letters when we are absent, such [we will] also [be] in deed when we are present. </verse>
			<verse num="12"> For we dare not class ourselves or compare ourselves with those who commend themselves. But they, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise. </verse>
			<verse num="13"> We, however, will not boast beyond measure, but within the limits of the sphere which God appointed us -- a sphere which especially includes you. </verse>
			<verse num="14"> For we are not overextending ourselves (as though [our authority] did not extend to you), for it was to you that we came with the gospel of Christ; </verse>
			<verse num="15"> not boasting of things beyond measure, [that is,] in other men's labors, but having hope, [that] as your faith is increased, we shall be greatly enlarged by you in our sphere, </verse>
			<verse num="16"> to preach the gospel in the [regions] beyond you, [and] not to boast in another man's sphere of accomplishment. </verse>
			<verse num="17"> But "he who glories, let him glory in the LORD." </verse>
			<verse num="18"> For not he who commends himself is approved, but whom the Lord commends. </verse>
		</chapter>
		<chapter num="11">
			<verse num="1"> Oh, that you would bear with me in a little folly -- and indeed you do bear with me. </verse>
			<verse num="2"> For I am jealous for you with godly jealousy. For I have betrothed you to one husband, that I may present [you as] a chaste virgin to Christ. </verse>
			<verse num="3"> But I fear, lest somehow, as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness, so your minds may be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ. </verse>
			<verse num="4"> For if he who comes preaches another Jesus whom we have not preached, or [if] you receive a different spirit which you have not received, or a different gospel which you have not accepted -- you may well put up with it! </verse>
			<verse num="5"> For I consider that I am not at all inferior to the most eminent apostles. </verse>
			<verse num="6"> Even though [I am] untrained in speech, yet [I am] not in knowledge. But we have been thoroughly manifested among you in all things. </verse>
			<verse num="7"> Did I commit sin in humbling myself that you might be exalted, because I preached the gospel of God to you free of charge? </verse>
			<verse num="8"> I robbed other churches, taking wages [from them] to minister to you. </verse>
			<verse num="9"> And when I was present with you, and in need, I was a burden to no one, for what I lacked the brethren who came from Macedonia supplied. And in everything I kept myself from being burdensome to you, and so I will keep [myself.] </verse>
			<verse num="10"> As the truth of Christ is in me, no one shall stop me from this boasting in the regions of Achaia. </verse>
			<verse num="11"> Why? Because I do not love you? God knows! </verse>
			<verse num="12"> But what I do, I will also continue to do, that I may cut off the opportunity from those who desire an opportunity to be regarded just as we are in the things of which they boast. </verse>
			<verse num="13"> For such [are] false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into apostles of Christ. </verse>
			<verse num="14"> And no wonder! For Satan himself transforms himself into an angel of light. </verse>
			<verse num="15"> Therefore [it is] no great thing if his ministers also transform themselves into ministers of righteousness, whose end will be according to their works. </verse>
			<verse num="16"> I say again, let no one think me a fool. If otherwise, at least receive me as a fool, that I also may boast a little. </verse>
			<verse num="17"> What I speak, I speak not according to the Lord, but as it were, foolishly, in this confidence of boasting. </verse>
			<verse num="18"> Seeing that many boast according to the flesh, I also will boast. </verse>
			<verse num="19"> For you put up with fools gladly, since you [yourselves] are wise! </verse>
			<verse num="20"> For you put up with it if one brings you into bondage, if one devours [you,] if one takes [from you,] if one exalts himself, if one strikes you on the face. </verse>
			<verse num="21"> To [our] shame, I say that we were too weak for that! But in whatever anyone is bold -- I speak foolishly -- I am bold also. </verse>
			<verse num="22"> Are they Hebrews? So [am] I. Are they Israelites? So [am] I. Are they the seed of Abraham? So [am] I. </verse>
			<verse num="23"> Are they ministers of Christ? -- I speak as a fool -- I [am] more: in labors more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequently, in deaths often. </verse>
			<verse num="24"> From the Jews five times I received forty [stripes] minus one. </verse>
			<verse num="25"> Three times I was beaten with rods; once I was stoned; three times I was shipwrecked; a night and a day I have been in the deep; </verse>
			<verse num="26"> [in] journeys often, [in] perils of waters, [in] perils of robbers, [in] perils of [my own] countrymen, [in] perils of the Gentiles, [in] perils in the city, [in] perils in the wilderness, [in] perils in the sea, [in] perils among false brethren; </verse>
			<verse num="27"> in weariness and toil, in sleeplessness often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness -- </verse>
			<verse num="28"> besides the other things, what comes upon me daily: my deep concern for all the churches. </verse>
			<verse num="29"> Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is made to stumble, and I do not burn with indignation? </verse>
			<verse num="30"> If I must boast, I will boast in the things which concern my infirmity. </verse>
			<verse num="31"> The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed forever, knows that I am not lying. </verse>
			<verse num="32"> In Damascus the governor, under Aretas the king, was guarding the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desiring to arrest me; </verse>
			<verse num="33"> but I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall, and escaped from his hands. </verse>
		</chapter>
		<chapter num="12">
			<verse num="1"> It is doubtless not profitable for me to boast. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord: </verse>
			<verse num="2"> I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago -- whether in the body I do not know, or whether out of the body I do not know, God knows -- such a one was caught up to the third heaven. </verse>
			<verse num="3"> And I know such a man -- whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, God knows -- </verse>
			<verse num="4"> how he was caught up into Paradise and heard inexpressible words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter. </verse>
			<verse num="5"> Of such a one I will boast; yet of myself I will not boast, except in my infirmities. </verse>
			<verse num="6"> For though I might desire to boast, I will not be a fool; for I will speak the truth. But I refrain, lest anyone should think of me above what he sees me [to be] or hears from me. </verse>
			<verse num="7"> And lest I should be exalted above measure by the abundance of the revelations, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I be exalted above measure. </verse>
			<verse num="8"> Concerning this thing I pleaded with the Lord three times that it might depart from me. </verse>
			<verse num="9"> And He said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness." Therefore most gladly I will rather boast in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. </verse>
			<verse num="10"> Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in needs, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ's sake. For when I am weak, then I am strong. </verse>
			<verse num="11"> I have become a fool in boasting; you have compelled me. For I ought to have been commended by you; for in nothing was I behind the most eminent apostles, though I am nothing. </verse>
			<verse num="12"> Truly the signs of an apostle were accomplished among you with all perseverance, in signs and wonders and mighty deeds. </verse>
			<verse num="13"> For what is it in which you were inferior to other churches, except that I myself was not burdensome to you? Forgive me this wrong! </verse>
			<verse num="14"> Now [for] the third time I am ready to come to you. And I will not be burdensome to you; for I do not seek yours, but you. For the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children. </verse>
			<verse num="15"> And I will very gladly spend and be spent for your souls; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I am loved. </verse>
			<verse num="16"> But be that [as it may,] I did not burden you. Nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you by cunning! </verse>
			<verse num="17"> Did I take advantage of you by any of those whom I sent to you? </verse>
			<verse num="18"> I urged Titus, and sent our brother with [him.] Did Titus take advantage of you? Did we not walk in the same spirit? Did [we] not [walk] in the same steps? </verse>
			<verse num="19"> Again, do you think that we excuse ourselves to you? We speak before God in Christ. But [we do] all things, beloved, for your edification. </verse>
			<verse num="20"> For I fear lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I wish, and [that] I shall be found by you such as you do not wish; lest [there be] contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, backbitings, whisperings, conceits, tumults; </verse>
			<verse num="21"> lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and I shall mourn for many who have sinned before and have not repented of the uncleanness, fornication, and lewdness which they have practiced. </verse>
		</chapter>
		<chapter num="13">
			<verse num="1"> This [will be] the third [time] I am coming to you. "By the mouth of two or three witnesses every word shall be established." </verse>
			<verse num="2"> I have told you before, and foretell as if I were present the second time, and now being absent I write to those who have sinned before, and to all the rest, that if I come again I will not spare -- </verse>
			<verse num="3"> since you seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, who is not weak toward you, but mighty in you. </verse>
			<verse num="4"> For though He was crucified in weakness, yet He lives by the power of God. For we also are weak in Him, but we shall live with Him by the power of God toward you. </verse>
			<verse num="5"> Examine yourselves [as to] whether you are in the faith. Test yourselves. Do you not know yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you? -- unless indeed you are disqualified. </verse>
			<verse num="6"> But I trust that you will know that we are not disqualified. </verse>
			<verse num="7"> Now I pray to God that you do no evil, not that we should appear approved, but that you should do what is honorable, though we may seem disqualified. </verse>
			<verse num="8"> For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth. </verse>
			<verse num="9"> For we are glad when we are weak and you are strong. And this also we pray, that you may be made complete. </verse>
			<verse num="10"> Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the authority which the Lord has given me for edification and not for destruction. </verse>
			<verse num="11"> Finally, brethren, farewell. Become complete. Be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace will be with you. </verse>
			<verse num="12"> Greet one another with a holy kiss. </verse>
			<verse num="13"> All the saints greet you. </verse>
			<verse num="14"> The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit [be] with you all. Amen. </verse>
