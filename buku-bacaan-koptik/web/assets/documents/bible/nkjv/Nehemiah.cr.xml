			<verse num="1"> The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. It came to pass in the month of Chislev, [in] the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the citadel, </verse>
			<verse num="2"> that Hanani one of my brethren came with men from Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews who had escaped, who had survived the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem. </verse>
			<verse num="3"> And they said to me, "The survivors who are left from the captivity in the province [are] there in great distress and reproach. The wall of Jerusalem [is] also broken down, and its gates [are burned] with fire." </verse>
			<verse num="4"> So it was, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned [for many] days; I was fasting and praying before the God of heaven. </verse>
			<verse num="5"> And I said: "I pray, LORD God of heaven, O great and awesome God, [You] who keep [Your] covenant and mercy with those who love You and observe Your commandments, </verse>
			<verse num="6"> "please let Your ear be attentive and Your eyes open, that You may hear the prayer of Your servant which I pray before You now, day and night, for the children of Israel Your servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel which we have sinned against You. Both my father's house and I have sinned. </verse>
			<verse num="7"> "We have acted very corruptly against You, and have not kept the commandments, the statutes, nor the ordinances which You commanded Your servant Moses. </verse>
			<verse num="8"> "Remember, I pray, the word that You commanded Your servant Moses, saying, '[If] you are unfaithful, I will scatter you among the nations; </verse>
			<verse num="9"> 'but [if] you return to Me, and keep My commandments and do them, though some of you were cast out to the farthest part of the heavens, [yet] I will gather them from there, and bring them to the place which I have chosen as a dwelling for My name.' </verse>
			<verse num="10"> "Now these [are] Your servants and Your people, whom You have redeemed by Your great power, and by Your strong hand. </verse>
			<verse num="11"> "O Lord, I pray, please let Your ear be attentive to the prayer of Your servant, and to the prayer of Your servants who desire to fear Your name; and let Your servant prosper this day, I pray, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man." For I was the king's cupbearer. </verse>

		<chapter num="2">
			<verse num="1"> And it came to pass in the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, [when] wine [was] before him, that I took the wine and gave it to the king. Now I had never been sad in his presence before. </verse>
			<verse num="2"> Therefore the king said to me, "Why [is] your face sad, since you [are] not sick? This [is] nothing but sorrow of heart." So I became dreadfully afraid, </verse>
			<verse num="3"> and said to the king, "May the king live forever! Why should my face not be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' tombs, [lies] waste, and its gates are burned with fire?" </verse>
			<verse num="4"> Then the king said to me, "What do you request?" So I prayed to the God of heaven. </verse>
			<verse num="5"> And I said to the king, "If it pleases the king, and if your servant has found favor in your sight, I ask that you send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers' tombs, that I may rebuild it." </verse>
			<verse num="6"> Then the king said to me (the queen also sitting beside him), "How long will your journey be? And when will you return?" So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time. </verse>
			<verse num="7"> Furthermore I said to the king, "If it pleases the king, let letters be given to me for the governors [of the region] beyond the River, that they must permit me to pass through till I come to Judah, </verse>
			<verse num="8"> "and a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that he must give me timber to make beams for the gates of the citadel which [pertains] to the temple, for the city wall, and for the house that I will occupy." And the king granted [them] to me according to the good hand of my God upon me. </verse>
			<verse num="9"> Then I went to the governors [in the region] beyond the River, and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me. </verse>
			<verse num="10"> When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard [of it,] they were deeply disturbed that a man had come to seek the well-being of the children of Israel. </verse>
			<verse num="11"> So I came to Jerusalem and was there three days. </verse>
			<verse num="12"> Then I arose in the night, I and a few men with me; I told no one what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem; nor was there any animal with me, except the one on which I rode. </verse>
			<verse num="13"> And I went out by night through the Valley Gate to the Serpent Well and the Refuse Gate, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem which were broken down and its gates which were burned with fire. </verse>
			<verse num="14"> Then I went on to the Fountain Gate and to the King's Pool, but [there was] no room for the animal under me to pass. </verse>
			<verse num="15"> So I went up in the night by the valley, and viewed the wall; then I turned back and entered by the Valley Gate, and so returned. </verse>
			<verse num="16"> And the officials did not know where I had gone or what I had done; I had not yet told the Jews, the priests, the nobles, the officials, or the others who did the work. </verse>
			<verse num="17"> Then I said to them, "You see the distress that we [are] in, how Jerusalem [lies] waste, and its gates are burned with fire. Come and let us build the wall of Jerusalem, that we may no longer be a reproach." </verse>
			<verse num="18"> And I told them of the hand of my God which had been good upon me, and also of the king's words that he had spoken to me. So they said, "Let us rise up and build." Then they set their hands to [this] good [work.] </verse>
			<verse num="19"> But when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite official, and Geshem the Arab heard [of it,] they laughed at us and despised us, and said, "What [is] this thing that you are doing? Will you rebel against the king?" </verse>
			<verse num="20"> So I answered them, and said to them, "The God of heaven Himself will prosper us; therefore we His servants will arise and build, but you have no heritage or right or memorial in Jerusalem." </verse>

		<chapter num="4">
			<verse num="1"> But it so happened, when Sanballat heard that we were rebuilding the wall, that he was furious and very indignant, and mocked the Jews. </verse>
			<verse num="2"> And he spoke before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, "What are these feeble Jews doing? Will they fortify themselves? Will they offer sacrifices? Will they complete it in a day? Will they revive the stones from the heaps of rubbish -- [stones] that are burned?" </verse>
			<verse num="3"> Now Tobiah the Ammonite [was] beside him, and he said, "Whatever they build, if even a fox goes up [on it,] he will break down their stone wall." </verse>
			<verse num="4"> Hear, O our God, for we are despised; turn their reproach on their own heads, and give them as plunder to a land of captivity! </verse>
			<verse num="5"> Do not cover their iniquity, and do not let their sin be blotted out from before You; for they have provoked [You] to anger before the builders. </verse>
			<verse num="6"> So we built the wall, and the entire wall was joined together up to half its [height,] for the people had a mind to work. </verse>
			<verse num="7"> Now it happened, when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites heard that the walls of Jerusalem were being restored and the gaps were beginning to be closed, that they became very angry, </verse>
			<verse num="8"> and all of them conspired together to come [and] attack Jerusalem and create confusion. </verse>
			<verse num="9"> Nevertheless we made our prayer to our God, and because of them we set a watch against them day and night. </verse>
			<verse num="10"> Then Judah said, "The strength of the laborers is failing, and [there is] so much rubbish that we are not able to build the wall." </verse>
			<verse num="11"> And our adversaries said, "They will neither know nor see anything, till we come into their midst and kill them and cause the work to cease." </verse>
			<verse num="12"> So it was, when the Jews who dwelt near them came, that they told us ten times, "From whatever place you turn, [they will be] upon us." </verse>
			<verse num="13"> Therefore I positioned [men] behind the lower parts of the wall, at the openings; and I set the people according to their families, with their swords, their spears, and their bows. </verse>
			<verse num="14"> And I looked, and arose and said to the nobles, to the leaders, and to the rest of the people, "Do not be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, great and awesome, and fight for your brethren, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your houses." </verse>
			<verse num="15"> And it happened, when our enemies heard that it was known to us, and [that] God had brought their plot to nothing, that all of us returned to the wall, everyone to his work. </verse>
			<verse num="16"> So it was, from that time on, [that] half of my servants worked at construction, while the other half held the spears, the shields, the bows, and [wore] armor; and the leaders [were] behind all the house of Judah. </verse>
			<verse num="17"> Those who built on the wall, and those who carried burdens, loaded themselves so that with one hand they worked at construction, and with the other held a weapon. </verse>
			<verse num="18"> Every one of the builders had his sword girded at his side as he built. And the one who sounded the trumpet [was] beside me. </verse>
			<verse num="19"> Then I said to the nobles, the rulers, and the rest of the people, "The work [is] great and extensive, and we are separated far from one another on the wall. </verse>
			<verse num="20"> "Wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet, rally to us there. Our God will fight for us." </verse>
			<verse num="21"> So we labored in the work, and half of [the men] held the spears from daybreak until the stars appeared. </verse>
			<verse num="22"> At the same time I also said to the people, "Let each man and his servant stay at night in Jerusalem, that they may be our guard by night and a working party by day." </verse>
			<verse num="23"> So neither I, my brethren, my servants, nor the men of the guard who followed me took off our clothes, [except] that everyone took them off for washing. </verse>
		</chapter>
		<chapter num="5">
			<verse num="1"> And there was a great outcry of the people and their wives against their Jewish brethren. </verse>
			<verse num="2"> For there were those who said, "We, our sons, and our daughters [are] many; therefore let us get grain, that we may eat and live." </verse>
			<verse num="3"> There were also [some] who said, "We have mortgaged our lands and vineyards and houses, that we might buy grain because of the famine." </verse>
			<verse num="4"> There were also those who said, "We have borrowed money for the king's tax [on] our lands and vineyards. </verse>
			<verse num="5"> "Yet now our flesh [is] as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children; and indeed we are forcing our sons and our daughters to be slaves, and [some] of our daughters have been brought into slavery. [It is] not in our power [to redeem them,] for other men have our lands and vineyards." </verse>
			<verse num="6"> And I became very angry when I heard their outcry and these words. </verse>
			<verse num="7"> After serious thought, I rebuked the nobles and rulers, and said to them, "Each of you is exacting usury from his brother." So I called a great assembly against them. </verse>
			<verse num="8"> And I said to them, "According to our ability we have redeemed our Jewish brethren who were sold to the nations. Now indeed, will you even sell your brethren? Or should they be sold to us?" Then they were silenced and found nothing [to say.] </verse>
			<verse num="9"> Then I said, "What you are doing [is] not good. Should you not walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the nations, our enemies?" </verse>
			<verse num="10"> "I also, [with] my brethren and my servants, am lending them money and grain. Please, let us stop this usury! </verse>
			<verse num="11"> "Restore now to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their olive groves, and their houses, also a hundredth of the money and the grain, the new wine and the oil, that you have charged them." </verse>
			<verse num="12"> So they said, "We will restore [it,] and will require nothing from them; we will do as you say." Then I called the priests, and required an oath from them that they would do according to this promise. </verse>
			<verse num="13"> Then I shook out the fold of my garment and said, "So may God shake out each man from his house, and from his property, who does not perform this promise. Even thus may he be shaken out and emptied." And all the assembly said, "Amen!" and praised the LORD. Then the people did according to this promise. </verse>
			<verse num="14"> Moreover, from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year until the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes, twelve years, neither I nor my brothers ate the governor's provisions. </verse>
			<verse num="15"> But the former governors who [were] before me laid burdens on the people, and took from them bread and wine, besides forty shekels of silver. Yes, even their servants bore rule over the people, but I did not do so, because of the fear of God. </verse>
			<verse num="16"> Indeed, I also continued the work on this wall, and we did not buy any land. All my servants [were] gathered there for the work. </verse>
			<verse num="17"> And at my table [were] one hundred and fifty Jews and rulers, besides those who came to us from the nations around us. </verse>
			<verse num="18"> Now [that] which was prepared daily [was] one ox [and] six choice sheep. Also fowl were prepared for me, and once every ten days an abundance of all kinds of wine. Yet in spite of this I did not demand the governor's provisions, because the bondage was heavy on this people. </verse>
			<verse num="19"> Remember me, my God, for good, [according to] all that I have done for this people. </verse>
		</chapter>
		<chapter num="6">
			<verse num="1"> Now it happened when Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab, and the rest of our enemies heard that I had rebuilt the wall, and [that] there were no breaks left in it (though at that time I had not hung the doors in the gates), </verse>
			<verse num="2"> that Sanballat and Geshem sent to me, saying, "Come, let us meet together among the villages in the plain of Ono." But they thought to do me harm. </verse>
			<verse num="3"> So I sent messengers to them, saying, "I [am] doing a great work, so that I cannot come down. Why should the work cease while I leave it and go down to you?" </verse>
			<verse num="4"> But they sent me this message four times, and I answered them in the same manner. </verse>
			<verse num="5"> Then Sanballat sent his servant to me as before, the fifth time, with an open letter in his hand. </verse>
			<verse num="6"> In it [was] written: It is reported among the nations, and Geshem says, [that] you and the Jews plan to rebel; therefore, according to these rumors, you are rebuilding the wall, that you may be their king. </verse>
			<verse num="7"> And you have also appointed prophets to proclaim concerning you at Jerusalem, saying, '[There is] a king in Judah!' Now these matters will be reported to the king. So come, therefore, and let us consult together. </verse>
			<verse num="8"> Then I sent to him, saying, "No such things as you say are being done, but you invent them in your own heart." </verse>
			<verse num="9"> For they all [were trying to] make us afraid, saying, "Their hands will be weakened in the work, and it will not be done." Now therefore, [O God,] strengthen my hands. </verse>
			<verse num="10"> Afterward I came to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel, who [was] a secret informer; and he said, "Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us close the doors of the temple, for they are coming to kill you; indeed, at night they will come to kill you." </verse>
			<verse num="11"> And I said, "Should such a man as I flee? And who [is there] such as I who would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in!" </verse>
			<verse num="12"> Then I perceived that God had not sent him at all, but that he pronounced [this] prophecy against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him. </verse>
			<verse num="13"> For this reason he [was] hired, that I should be afraid and act that way and sin, so [that] they might have [cause] for an evil report, that they might reproach me. </verse>
			<verse num="14"> My God, remember Tobiah and Sanballat, according to these their works, and the prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the prophets who would have made me afraid. </verse>
			<verse num="15"> So the wall was finished on the twenty-fifth [day] of Elul, in fifty-two days. </verse>
			<verse num="16"> And it happened, when all our enemies heard [of it,] and all the nations around us saw [these things,] that they were very disheartened in their own eyes; for they perceived that this work was done by our God. </verse>
			<verse num="17"> Also in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and [the letters of] Tobiah came to them. </verse>
			<verse num="18"> For many in Judah were pledged to him, because he was the son-in-law of Shechaniah the son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah. </verse>
			<verse num="19"> Also they reported his good deeds before me, and reported my words to him. Tobiah sent letters to frighten me. </verse>
		</chapter>
		<chapter num="7">
			<verse num="1"> Then it was, when the wall was built and I had hung the doors, when the gatekeepers, the singers, and the Levites had been appointed, </verse>
			<verse num="2"> that I gave the charge of Jerusalem to my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the leader of the citadel, for he [was] a faithful man and feared God more than many. </verse>
			<verse num="3"> And I said to them, "Do not let the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun is hot; and while they stand [guard,] let them shut and bar the doors; and appoint guards from among the inhabitants of Jerusalem, one at his watch station and another in front of his own house." </verse>
			<verse num="4"> Now the city [was] large and spacious, but the people in it [were] few, and the houses [were] not rebuilt. </verse>
			<verse num="5"> Then my God put it into my heart to gather the nobles, the rulers, and the people, that they might be registered by genealogy. And I found a register of the genealogy of those who had come up in the first [return,] and found written in it: </verse>
			<verse num="6"> These [are] the people of the province who came back from the captivity, of those who had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and who returned to Jerusalem and Judah, everyone to his city. </verse>

			<verse num="2"> So Ezra the priest brought the Law before the assembly of men and women and all who [could] hear with understanding on the first day of the seventh month. </verse>
			<verse num="3"> Then he read from it in the open square that [was] in front of the Water Gate from morning until midday, before the men and women and those who could understand; and the ears of all the people [were attentive] to the Book of the Law. </verse>
			<verse num="4"> So Ezra the scribe stood on a platform of wood which they had made for the purpose; and beside him, at his right hand, stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Urijah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah; and at his left hand Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchijah, Hashum, Hashbadana, Zechariah, [and] Meshullam. </verse>
			<verse num="5"> And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people, for he was [standing] above all the people; and when he opened it, all the people stood up. </verse>
			<verse num="6"> And Ezra blessed the LORD, the great God. Then all the people answered, "Amen, Amen!" while lifting up their hands. And they bowed their heads and worshiped the LORD with [their] faces to the ground. </verse>
			<verse num="7"> Also Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, helped the people to understand the Law; and the people [stood] in their place. </verse>
			<verse num="8"> So they read distinctly from the book, in the Law of God; and they gave the sense, and helped [them] to understand the reading. </verse>
			<verse num="9"> And Nehemiah, who [was] the governor, Ezra the priest [and] scribe, and the Levites who taught the people said to all the people, "This day [is] holy to the LORD your God; do not mourn nor weep." For all the people wept, when they heard the words of the Law. </verse>
			<verse num="10"> Then he said to them, "Go your way, eat the fat, drink the sweet, and send portions to those for whom nothing is prepared; for [this] day [is] holy to our LORD. Do not sorrow, for the joy of the LORD is your strength." </verse>

			<verse num="17"> So the whole assembly of those who had returned from the captivity made booths and sat under the booths; for since the days of Joshua the son of Nun until that day the children of Israel had not done so. And there was very great gladness. </verse>
			<verse num="18"> Also day by day, from the first day until the last day, he read from the Book of the Law of God. And they kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day [there was] a sacred assembly, according to the [prescribed] manner. </verse>

			<verse num="11"> And You divided the sea before them, So that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; And their persecutors You threw into the deep, As a stone into the mighty waters. </verse>
			<verse num="12"> Moreover You led them by day with a cloudy pillar, And by night with a pillar of fire, To give them light on the road Which they should travel. </verse>
			<verse num="13"> "You came down also on Mount Sinai, And spoke with them from heaven, And gave them just ordinances and true laws, Good statutes and commandments. </verse>

			<verse num="15"> You gave them bread from heaven for their hunger, And brought them water out of the rock for their thirst, And told them to go in to possess the land Which You had sworn to give them. </verse>

			<verse num="17"> They refused to obey, And they were not mindful of Your wonders That You did among them. But they hardened their necks, And in their rebellion They appointed a leader To return to their bondage. But You [are] God, Ready to pardon, Gracious and merciful, Slow to anger, Abundant in kindness, And did not forsake them. </verse>
			<verse num="18"> "Even when they made a molded calf for themselves, And said, 'This [is] your god That brought you up out of Egypt,' And worked great provocations, </verse>
			<verse num="19"> Yet in Your manifold mercies You did not forsake them in the wilderness. The pillar of the cloud did not depart from them by day, To lead them on the road; Nor the pillar of fire by night, To show them light, And the way they should go. </verse>
			<verse num="20"> You also gave Your good Spirit to instruct them, And did not withhold Your manna from their mouth, And gave them water for their thirst. </verse>
			<verse num="21"> Forty years You sustained them in the wilderness, They lacked nothing; Their clothes did not wear out And their feet did not swell. </verse>
			<verse num="22"> "Moreover You gave them kingdoms and nations, And divided them into districts. So they took possession of the land of Sihon, The land of the king of Heshbon, And the land of Og king of Bashan. </verse>
			<verse num="23"> You also multiplied their children as the stars of heaven, And brought them into the land Which You had told their fathers To go in and possess. </verse>
			<verse num="24"> So the people went in And possessed the land; You subdued before them the inhabitants of the land, The Canaanites, And gave them into their hands, With their kings And the people of the land, That they might do with them as they wished. </verse>
			<verse num="25"> And they took strong cities and a rich land, And possessed houses full of all goods, Cisterns [already] dug, vineyards, olive groves, And fruit trees in abundance. So they ate and were filled and grew fat, And delighted themselves in Your great goodness. </verse>
			<verse num="26"> " Nevertheless they were disobedient And rebelled against You, Cast Your law behind their backs And killed Your prophets, who testified against them To turn them to Yourself; And they worked great provocations. </verse>
			<verse num="27"> Therefore You delivered them into the hand of their enemies, Who oppressed them; And in the time of their trouble, When they cried to You, You heard from heaven; And according to Your abundant mercies You gave them deliverers who saved them From the hand of their enemies. </verse>
			<verse num="28"> "But after they had rest, They again did evil before You. Therefore You left them in the hand of their enemies, So that they had dominion over them; Yet when they returned and cried out to You, You heard from heaven; And many times You delivered them according to Your mercies, </verse>

			<verse num="23"> The sons of Levi, the heads of the fathers' [houses] until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib, [were] written in the book of the chronicles. </verse>
			<verse num="24"> And the heads of the Levites [were] Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel, with their brothers across from them, to praise [and] give thanks, group alternating with group, according to the command of David the man of God. </verse>
			<verse num="25"> Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub [were] gatekeepers keeping the watch at the storerooms of the gates. </verse>
			<verse num="26"> These [lived] in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the priest, the scribe. </verse>
			<verse num="27"> Now at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought out the Levites in all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem to celebrate the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings and singing, [with] cymbals and stringed instruments and harps. </verse>
			<verse num="28"> And the sons of the singers gathered together from the countryside around Jerusalem, from the villages of the Netophathites, </verse>
			<verse num="29"> from the house of Gilgal, and from the fields of Geba and Azmaveth; for the singers had built themselves villages all around Jerusalem. </verse>
			<verse num="30"> Then the priests and Levites purified themselves, and purified the people, the gates, and the wall. </verse>
			<verse num="31"> So I brought the leaders of Judah up on the wall, and appointed two large thanksgiving choirs. [One] went to the right hand on the wall toward the Refuse Gate. </verse>
			<verse num="32"> After them went Hoshaiah and half of the leaders of Judah, </verse>
			<verse num="33"> and Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam, </verse>
			<verse num="34"> Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, Jeremiah, </verse>
			<verse num="35"> and some of the priests' sons with trumpets -- Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Michaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph, </verse>
			<verse num="36"> and his brethren, Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah, [and] Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God. Ezra the scribe [went] before them. </verse>
			<verse num="37"> By the Fountain Gate, in front of them, they went up the stairs of the City of David, on the stairway of the wall, beyond the house of David, as far as the Water Gate eastward. </verse>
			<verse num="38"> The other thanksgiving choir went the opposite [way,] and I [was] behind them with half of the people on the wall, going past the Tower of the Ovens as far as the Broad Wall, </verse>
			<verse num="39"> and above the Gate of Ephraim, above the Old Gate, above the Fish Gate, the Tower of Hananel, the Tower of the Hundred, as far as the Sheep Gate; and they stopped by the Gate of the Prison. </verse>
			<verse num="40"> So the two thanksgiving choirs stood in the house of God, likewise I and the half of the rulers with me; </verse>
			<verse num="41"> and the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Minjamin, Michaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, [and] Hananiah, with trumpets; </verse>
			<verse num="42"> also Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam, and Ezer. The singers sang loudly with Jezrahiah the director. </verse>
			<verse num="43"> Also that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced, for God had made them rejoice with great joy; the women and the children also rejoiced, so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard afar off. </verse>
			<verse num="44"> And at the same time some were appointed over the rooms of the storehouse for the offerings, the firstfruits, and the tithes, to gather into them from the fields of the cities the portions specified by the Law for the priests and Levites; for Judah rejoiced over the priests and Levites who ministered. </verse>
			<verse num="45"> Both the singers and the gatekeepers kept the charge of their God and the charge of the purification, according to the command of David [and] Solomon his son. </verse>
			<verse num="46"> For in the days of David and Asaph of old [there were] chiefs of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving to God. </verse>
			<verse num="47"> In the days of Zerubbabel and in the days of Nehemiah all Israel gave the portions for the singers and the gatekeepers, a portion for each day. They also consecrated [holy things] for the Levites, and the Levites consecrated [them] for the children of Aaron. </verse>
		</chapter>
		<chapter num="13">
			<verse num="1"> On that day they read from the Book of Moses in the hearing of the people, and in it was found written that no Ammonite or Moabite should ever come into the assembly of God, </verse>
			<verse num="2"> because they had not met the children of Israel with bread and water, but hired Balaam against them to curse them. However, our God turned the curse into a blessing. </verse>
			<verse num="3"> So it was, when they had heard the Law, that they separated all the mixed multitude from Israel. </verse>
			<verse num="4"> Now before this, Eliashib the priest, having authority over the storerooms of the house of our God, [was] allied with Tobiah. </verse>
			<verse num="5"> And he had prepared for him a large room, where previously they had stored the grain offerings, the frankincense, the articles, the tithes of grain, the new wine and oil, which were commanded [to be given] to the Levites and singers and gatekeepers, and the offerings for the priests. </verse>
			<verse num="6"> But during all this I was not in Jerusalem, for in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I had returned to the king. Then after certain days I obtained leave from the king, </verse>
			<verse num="7"> and I came to Jerusalem and discovered the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, in preparing a room for him in the courts of the house of God. </verse>
			<verse num="8"> And it grieved me bitterly; therefore I threw all the household goods of Tobiah out of the room. </verse>
			<verse num="9"> Then I commanded them to cleanse the rooms; and I brought back into them the articles of the house of God, with the grain offering and the frankincense. </verse>
			<verse num="10"> I also realized that the portions for the Levites had not been given [them;] for each of the Levites and the singers who did the work had gone back to his field. </verse>
			<verse num="11"> So I contended with the rulers, and said, "Why is the house of God forsaken?" And I gathered them together and set them in their place. </verse>
			<verse num="12"> Then all Judah brought the tithe of the grain and the new wine and the oil to the storehouse. </verse>
			<verse num="13"> And I appointed as treasurers over the storehouse Shelemiah the priest and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah; and next to them [was] Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah; for they were considered faithful, and their task [was] to distribute to their brethren. </verse>
			<verse num="14"> Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and do not wipe out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for its services! </verse>
			<verse num="15"> In those days I saw [people] in Judah treading wine presses on the Sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and loading donkeys with wine, grapes, figs, and all [kinds of] burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day. And I warned [them] about the day on which they were selling provisions. </verse>
			<verse num="16"> Men of Tyre dwelt there also, who brought in fish and all kinds of goods, and sold [them] on the Sabbath to the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem. </verse>
			<verse num="17"> Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said to them, "What evil thing [is] this that you do, by which you profane the Sabbath day? </verse>
			<verse num="18"> "Did not your fathers do thus, and did not our God bring all this disaster on us and on this city? Yet you bring added wrath on Israel by profaning the Sabbath." </verse>
			<verse num="19"> So it was, at the gates of Jerusalem, as it began to be dark before the Sabbath, that I commanded the gates to be shut, and charged that they must not be opened till after the Sabbath. Then I posted [some] of my servants at the gates, [so that] no burdens would be brought in on the Sabbath day. </verse>
			<verse num="20"> Now the merchants and sellers of all kinds of wares lodged outside Jerusalem once or twice. </verse>
			<verse num="21"> Then I warned them, and said to them, "Why do you spend the night around the wall? If you do [so] again, I will lay hands on you!" From that time on they came no [more] on the Sabbath. </verse>
			<verse num="22"> And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and that they should go and guard the gates, to sanctify the Sabbath day. Remember me, O my God, [concerning] this also, and spare me according to the greatness of Your mercy! </verse>
			<verse num="23"> In those days I also saw Jews [who] had married women of Ashdod, Ammon, [and] Moab. </verse>
			<verse num="24"> And half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod, and could not speak the language of Judah, but spoke according to the language of one or the other people. </verse>
			<verse num="25"> So I contended with them and cursed them, struck some of them and pulled out their hair, and made them swear by God, [saying,] "You shall not give your daughters as wives to their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons or yourselves. </verse>
			<verse num="26"> "Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? Yet among many nations there was no king like him, who was beloved of his God; and God made him king over all Israel. Nevertheless pagan women caused even him to sin. </verse>
			<verse num="27"> "Should we then hear of your doing all this great evil, transgressing against our God by marrying pagan women?" </verse>
			<verse num="28"> And [one] of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, [was] a son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonite; therefore I drove him from me. </verse>
			<verse num="29"> Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites. </verse>
			<verse num="30"> Thus I cleansed them of everything pagan. I also assigned duties to the priests and the Levites, each to his service, </verse>
			<verse num="31"> and [to bringing] the wood offering and the firstfruits at appointed times. Remember me, O my God, for good! </verse>
