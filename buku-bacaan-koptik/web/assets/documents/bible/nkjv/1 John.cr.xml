			<verse num="1"> That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, concerning the Word of life -- </verse>
			<verse num="2"> the life was manifested, and we have seen, and bear witness, and declare to you that eternal life which was with the Father and was manifested to us -- </verse>
			<verse num="3"> that which we have seen and heard we declare to you, that you also may have fellowship with us; and truly our fellowship [is] with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ. </verse>
			<verse num="4"> And these things we write to you that your joy may be full. </verse>
			<verse num="5"> This is the message which we have heard from Him and declare to you, that God is light and in Him is no darkness at all. </verse>
			<verse num="6"> If we say that we have fellowship with Him, and walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth. </verse>
			<verse num="7"> But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin. </verse>
			<verse num="8"> If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. </verse>
			<verse num="9"> If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us [our] sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. </verse>
			<verse num="10"> If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar, and His word is not in us. </verse>
		</chapter>
		<chapter num="2">
			<verse num="1"> My little children, these things I write to you, so that you may not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. </verse>
			<verse num="2"> And He Himself is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the whole world. </verse>
			<verse num="3"> Now by this we know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments. </verse>
			<verse num="4"> He who says, "I know Him," and does not keep His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. </verse>
			<verse num="5"> But whoever keeps His word, truly the love of God is perfected in him. By this we know that we are in Him. </verse>
			<verse num="6"> He who says he abides in Him ought himself also to walk just as He walked. </verse>
			<verse num="7"> Brethren, I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you have had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which you heard from the beginning. </verse>
			<verse num="8"> Again, a new commandment I write to you, which thing is true in Him and in you, because the darkness is passing away, and the true light is already shining. </verse>
			<verse num="9"> He who says he is in the light, and hates his brother, is in darkness until now. </verse>
			<verse num="10"> He who loves his brother abides in the light, and there is no cause for stumbling in him. </verse>
			<verse num="11"> But he who hates his brother is in darkness and walks in darkness, and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes. </verse>
			<verse num="12"> I write to you, little children, Because your sins are forgiven you for His name's sake. </verse>
			<verse num="13"> I write to you, fathers, Because you have known Him [who is] from the beginning. I write to you, young men, Because you have overcome the wicked one. I write to you, little children, Because you have known the Father. </verse>
			<verse num="14"> I have written to you, fathers, Because you have known Him [who is] from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, Because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, And you have overcome the wicked one. </verse>
			<verse num="15"> Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. </verse>
			<verse num="16"> For all that [is] in the world -- the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life -- is not of the Father but is of the world. </verse>
			<verse num="17"> And the world is passing away, and the lust of it; but he who does the will of God abides forever. </verse>
			<verse num="18"> Little children, it is the last hour; and as you have heard that the Antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come, by which we know that it is the last hour. </verse>
			<verse num="19"> They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us; but [they went out] that they might be made manifest, that none of them were of us. </verse>
			<verse num="20"> But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you know all things. </verse>
			<verse num="21"> I have not written to you because you do not know the truth, but because you know it, and that no lie is of the truth. </verse>
			<verse num="22"> Who is a liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist who denies the Father and the Son. </verse>
			<verse num="23"> Whoever denies the Son does not have the Father either; he who acknowledges the Son has the Father also. </verse>
			<verse num="24"> Therefore let that abide in you which you heard from the beginning. If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, you also will abide in the Son and in the Father. </verse>
			<verse num="25"> And this is the promise that He has promised us -- eternal life. </verse>
			<verse num="26"> These things I have written to you concerning those who [try to] deceive you. </verse>
			<verse num="27"> But the anointing which you have received from Him abides in you, and you do not need that anyone teach you; but as the same anointing teaches you concerning all things, and is true, and is not a lie, and just as it has taught you, you will abide in Him. </verse>
			<verse num="28"> And now, little children, abide in Him, that when He appears, we may have confidence and not be ashamed before Him at His coming. </verse>
			<verse num="29"> If you know that He is righteous, you know that everyone who practices righteousness is born of Him. </verse>
		</chapter>
		<chapter num="3">
			<verse num="1"> Behold what manner of love the Father has bestowed on us, that we should be called children of God! Therefore the world does not know us, because it did not know Him. </verse>
			<verse num="2"> Beloved, now we are children of God; and it has not yet been revealed what we shall be, but we know that when He is revealed, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is. </verse>
			<verse num="3"> And everyone who has this hope in Him purifies himself, just as He is pure. </verse>
			<verse num="4"> Whoever commits sin also commits lawlessness, and sin is lawlessness. </verse>
			<verse num="5"> And you know that He was manifested to take away our sins, and in Him there is no sin. </verse>
			<verse num="6"> Whoever abides in Him does not sin. Whoever sins has neither seen Him nor known Him. </verse>
			<verse num="7"> Little children, let no one deceive you. He who practices righteousness is righteous, just as He is righteous. </verse>
			<verse num="8"> He who sins is of the devil, for the devil has sinned from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil. </verse>
			<verse num="9"> Whoever has been born of God does not sin, for His seed remains in him; and he cannot sin, because he has been born of God. </verse>
			<verse num="10"> In this the children of God and the children of the devil are manifest: Whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor [is] he who does not love his brother. </verse>
			<verse num="11"> For this is the message that you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another, </verse>
			<verse num="12"> not as Cain [who] was of the wicked one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his works were evil and his brother's righteous. </verse>
			<verse num="13"> Do not marvel, my brethren, if the world hates you. </verse>
			<verse num="14"> We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren. He who does not love [his] brother abides in death. </verse>
			<verse num="15"> Whoever hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him. </verse>
			<verse num="16"> By this we know love, because He laid down His life for us. And we also ought to lay down [our] lives for the brethren. </verse>
			<verse num="17"> But whoever has this world's goods, and sees his brother in need, and shuts up his heart from him, how does the love of God abide in him? </verse>
			<verse num="18"> My little children, let us not love in word or in tongue, but in deed and in truth. </verse>
			<verse num="19"> And by this we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before Him. </verse>
			<verse num="20"> For if our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things. </verse>
			<verse num="21"> Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, we have confidence toward God. </verse>
			<verse num="22"> And whatever we ask we receive from Him, because we keep His commandments and do those things that are pleasing in His sight. </verse>
			<verse num="23"> And this is His commandment: that we should believe on the name of His Son Jesus Christ and love one another, as He gave us commandment. </verse>
			<verse num="24"> Now he who keeps His commandments abides in Him, and He in him. And by this we know that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He has given us. </verse>
		</chapter>
		<chapter num="4">
			<verse num="1"> Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits, whether they are of God; because many false prophets have gone out into the world. </verse>
			<verse num="2"> By this you know the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God, </verse>
			<verse num="3"> and every spirit that does not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God. And this is the [spirit] of the Antichrist, which you have heard was coming, and is now already in the world. </verse>
			<verse num="4"> You are of God, little children, and have overcome them, because He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world. </verse>
			<verse num="5"> They are of the world. Therefore they speak [as] of the world, and the world hears them. </verse>
			<verse num="6"> We are of God. He who knows God hears us; he who is not of God does not hear us. By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error. </verse>
			<verse num="7"> Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of God; and everyone who loves is born of God and knows God. </verse>
			<verse num="8"> He who does not love does not know God, for God is love. </verse>
			<verse num="9"> In this the love of God was manifested toward us, that God has sent His only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through Him. </verse>
			<verse num="10"> In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son [to be] the propitiation for our sins. </verse>
			<verse num="11"> Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. </verse>
			<verse num="12"> No one has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God abides in us, and His love has been perfected in us. </verse>
			<verse num="13"> By this we know that we abide in Him, and He in us, because He has given us of His Spirit. </verse>
			<verse num="14"> And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son [as] Savior of the world. </verse>
			<verse num="15"> Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God. </verse>
			<verse num="16"> And we have known and believed the love that God has for us. God is love, and he who abides in love abides in God, and God in him. </verse>
			<verse num="17"> Love has been perfected among us in this: that we may have boldness in the day of judgment; because as He is, so are we in this world. </verse>
			<verse num="18"> There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear involves torment. But he who fears has not been made perfect in love. </verse>
			<verse num="19"> We love Him because He first loved us. </verse>
			<verse num="20"> If someone says, "I love God," and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen? </verse>
			<verse num="21"> And this commandment we have from Him: that he who loves God [must] love his brother also. </verse>
		</chapter>
		<chapter num="5">
			<verse num="1"> Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and everyone who loves Him who begot also loves him who is begotten of Him. </verse>
			<verse num="2"> By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and keep His commandments. </verse>
			<verse num="3"> For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments. And His commandments are not burdensome. </verse>
			<verse num="4"> For whatever is born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world -- our faith. </verse>
			<verse num="5"> Who is he who overcomes the world, but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God? </verse>
			<verse num="6"> This is He who came by water and blood -- Jesus Christ; not only by water, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit who bears witness, because the Spirit is truth. </verse>
			<verse num="7"> For there are three that bear witness in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these three are one. </verse>
			<verse num="8"> And there are three that bear witness on earth: the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and these three agree as one. </verse>
			<verse num="9"> If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater; for this is the witness of God which He has testified of His Son. </verse>
			<verse num="10"> He who believes in the Son of God has the witness in himself; he who does not believe God has made Him a liar, because he has not believed the testimony that God has given of His Son. </verse>
			<verse num="11"> And this is the testimony: that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. </verse>
			<verse num="12"> He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life. </verse>
			<verse num="13"> These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you may [continue to] believe in the name of the Son of God. </verse>
			<verse num="14"> Now this is the confidence that we have in Him, that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us. </verse>
			<verse num="15"> And if we know that He hears us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we have asked of Him. </verse>
			<verse num="16"> If anyone sees his brother sinning a sin [which does] not [lead] to death, he will ask, and He will give him life for those who commit sin not [leading] to death. There is sin [leading] to death. I do not say that he should pray about that. </verse>
			<verse num="17"> All unrighteousness is sin, and there is sin not [leading] to death. </verse>
			<verse num="18"> We know that whoever is born of God does not sin; but he who has been born of God keeps himself, and the wicked one does not touch him. </verse>
			<verse num="19"> We know that we are of God, and the whole world lies [under the sway of] the wicked one. </verse>
			<verse num="20"> And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us an understanding, that we may know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life. </verse>
			<verse num="21"> Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen. </verse>
