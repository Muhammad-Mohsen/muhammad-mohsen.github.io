			<verse num="1"> Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy [our] brother, To Philemon our beloved [friend] and fellow laborer, </verse>
			<verse num="2"> to the beloved Apphia, Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house: </verse>
			<verse num="3"> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. </verse>
			<verse num="4"> I thank my God, making mention of you always in my prayers, </verse>
			<verse num="5"> hearing of your love and faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints, </verse>
			<verse num="6"> that the sharing of your faith may become effective by the acknowledgment of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus. </verse>
			<verse num="7"> For we have great joy and consolation in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed by you, brother. </verse>
			<verse num="8"> Therefore, though I might be very bold in Christ to command you what is fitting, </verse>
			<verse num="9"> [yet] for love's sake I rather appeal [to you -- being] such a one as Paul, the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ -- </verse>
			<verse num="10"> I appeal to you for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten [while] in my chains, </verse>
			<verse num="11"> who once was unprofitable to you, but now is profitable to you and to me. </verse>
			<verse num="12"> I am sending him back. You therefore receive him, that is, my own heart, </verse>
			<verse num="13"> whom I wished to keep with me, that on your behalf he might minister to me in my chains for the gospel. </verse>
			<verse num="14"> But without your consent I wanted to do nothing, that your good deed might not be by compulsion, as it were, but voluntary. </verse>
			<verse num="15"> For perhaps he departed for a while for this [purpose,] that you might receive him forever, </verse>
			<verse num="16"> no longer as a slave but more than a slave -- a beloved brother, especially to me but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord. </verse>
			<verse num="17"> If then you count me as a partner, receive him as [you would] me. </verse>
			<verse num="18"> But if he has wronged you or owes anything, put that on my account. </verse>
			<verse num="19"> I, Paul, am writing with my own hand. I will repay -- not to mention to you that you owe me even your own self besides. </verse>
			<verse num="20"> Yes, brother, let me have joy from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in the Lord. </verse>
			<verse num="21"> Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say. </verse>
			<verse num="22"> But, meanwhile, also prepare a guest room for me, for I trust that through your prayers I shall be granted to you. </verse>
			<verse num="23"> Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you, </verse>
			<verse num="24"> [as do] Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow laborers. </verse>
			<verse num="25"> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with your spirit. Amen. </verse>
