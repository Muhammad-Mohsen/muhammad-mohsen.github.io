		<chapter num="1">
			<verse num="1"> There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name [was] Job; and that man was blameless and upright, and one who feared God and shunned evil. </verse>
			<verse num="2"> And seven sons and three daughters were born to him. </verse>
			<verse num="3"> Also, his possessions were seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred female donkeys, and a very large household, so that this man was the greatest of all the people of the East. </verse>
			<verse num="4"> And his sons would go and feast [in their] houses, each on his [appointed] day, and would send and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them. </verse>
			<verse num="5"> So it was, when the days of feasting had run their course, that Job would send and sanctify them, and he would rise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings [according to] the number of them all. For Job said, "It may be that my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts." Thus Job did regularly. </verse>
			<verse num="6"> Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came among them. </verse>
			<verse num="7"> And the LORD said to Satan, "From where do you come?" So Satan answered the LORD and said, "From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking back and forth on it." </verse>
			<verse num="8"> Then the LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered My servant Job, that [there is] none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and shuns evil?" </verse>
			<verse num="9"> So Satan answered the LORD and said, "Does Job fear God for nothing? </verse>
			<verse num="10"> "Have You not made a hedge around him, around his household, and around all that he has on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land. </verse>
			<verse num="11"> "But now, stretch out Your hand and touch all that he has, and he will surely curse You to Your face!" </verse>
			<verse num="12"> And the LORD said to Satan, "Behold, all that he has [is] in your power; only do not lay a hand on his [person."] So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD. </verse>
			<verse num="13"> Now there was a day when his sons and daughters [were] eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house; </verse>
			<verse num="14"> and a messenger came to Job and said, "The oxen were plowing and the donkeys feeding beside them, </verse>
			<verse num="15"> "when the Sabeans raided [them] and took them away -- indeed they have killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you!" </verse>
			<verse num="16"> While he [was] still speaking, another also came and said, "The fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them; and I alone have escaped to tell you!" </verse>
			<verse num="17"> While he [was] still speaking, another also came and said, "The Chaldeans formed three bands, raided the camels and took them away, yes, and killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you!" </verse>
			<verse num="18"> While he [was] still speaking, another also came and said, "Your sons and daughters [were] eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house, </verse>
			<verse num="19"> "and suddenly a great wind came from across the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young people, and they are dead; and I alone have escaped to tell you!" </verse>
			<verse num="20"> Then Job arose, tore his robe, and shaved his head; and he fell to the ground and worshiped. </verse>
			<verse num="21"> And he said: "Naked I came from my mother's womb, And naked shall I return there. The LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away; Blessed be the name of the LORD." </verse>
			<verse num="22"> In all this Job did not sin nor charge God with wrong. </verse>
		</chapter>
		<chapter num="2">
			<verse num="1"> Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD. </verse>
			<verse num="2"> And the LORD said to Satan, "From where do you come?" So Satan answered the LORD and said, "From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking back and forth on it." </verse>
			<verse num="3"> Then the LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered My servant Job, that [there is] none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and shuns evil? And still he holds fast to his integrity, although you incited Me against him, to destroy him without cause." </verse>
			<verse num="4"> So Satan answered the LORD and said, "Skin for skin! Yes, all that a man has he will give for his life. </verse>
			<verse num="5"> "But stretch out Your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will surely curse You to Your face!" </verse>
			<verse num="6"> And the LORD said to Satan, "Behold, he [is] in your hand, but spare his life." </verse>
			<verse num="7"> So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD, and struck Job with painful boils from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head. </verse>
			<verse num="8"> And he took for himself a potsherd with which to scrape himself while he sat in the midst of the ashes. </verse>
			<verse num="9"> Then his wife said to him, "Do you still hold fast to your integrity? Curse God and die!" </verse>
			<verse num="10"> But he said to her, "You speak as one of the foolish women speaks. Shall we indeed accept good from God, and shall we not accept adversity?" In all this Job did not sin with his lips. </verse>
			<verse num="11"> Now when Job's three friends heard of all this adversity that had come upon him, each one came from his own place -- Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. For they had made an appointment together to come and mourn with him, and to comfort him. </verse>
			<verse num="12"> And when they raised their eyes from afar, and did not recognize him, they lifted their voices and wept; and each one tore his robe and sprinkled dust on his head toward heaven. </verse>
			<verse num="13"> So they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that [his] grief was very great. </verse>
		</chapter>
		<chapter num="3">
			<verse num="1"> After this Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his [birth.] </verse>
			<verse num="2"> And Job spoke, and said: </verse>
			<verse num="3"> "May the day perish on which I was born, And the night [in which] it was said, 'A male child is conceived.' </verse>
			<verse num="4"> May that day be darkness; May God above not seek it, Nor the light shine upon it. </verse>
			<verse num="5"> May darkness and the shadow of death claim it; May a cloud settle on it; May the blackness of the day terrify it. </verse>
			<verse num="6"> [As for] that night, may darkness seize it; May it not rejoice among the days of the year, May it not come into the number of the months. </verse>
			<verse num="7"> Oh, may that night be barren! May no joyful shout come into it! </verse>
			<verse num="8"> May those curse it who curse the day, Those who are ready to arouse Leviathan. </verse>
			<verse num="9"> May the stars of its morning be dark; May it look for light, but [have] none, And not see the dawning of the day; </verse>
			<verse num="10"> Because it did not shut up the doors of my [mother's] womb, Nor hide sorrow from my eyes. </verse>
			<verse num="11"> "Why did I not die at birth? [Why] did I [not] perish when I came from the womb? </verse>
			<verse num="12"> Why did the knees receive me? Or why the breasts, that I should nurse? </verse>
			<verse num="13"> For now I would have lain still and been quiet, I would have been asleep; Then I would have been at rest </verse>
			<verse num="14"> With kings and counselors of the earth, Who built ruins for themselves, </verse>
			<verse num="15"> Or with princes who had gold, Who filled their houses [with] silver; </verse>
			<verse num="16"> Or [why] was I not hidden like a stillborn child, Like infants who never saw light? </verse>
			<verse num="17"> There the wicked cease [from] troubling, And there the weary are at rest. </verse>
			<verse num="18"> [There] the prisoners rest together; They do not hear the voice of the oppressor. </verse>
			<verse num="19"> The small and great are there, And the servant [is] free from his master. </verse>
			<verse num="20"> "Why is light given to him who is in misery, And life to the bitter of soul, </verse>
			<verse num="21"> Who long for death, but it does not [come,] And search for it more than hidden treasures; </verse>
			<verse num="22"> Who rejoice exceedingly, [And] are glad when they can find the grave? </verse>
			<verse num="23"> [Why is light given] to a man whose way is hidden, And whom God has hedged in? </verse>
			<verse num="24"> For my sighing comes before I eat, And my groanings pour out like water. </verse>
			<verse num="25"> For the thing I greatly feared has come upon me, And what I dreaded has happened to me. </verse>
			<verse num="26"> I am not at ease, nor am I quiet; I have no rest, for trouble comes." </verse>
		</chapter>
		<chapter num="4">
			<verse num="1"> Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said: </verse>
			<verse num="2"> "[If] one attempts a word with you, will you become weary? But who can withhold himself from speaking? </verse>
			<verse num="3"> Surely you have instructed many, And you have strengthened weak hands. </verse>
			<verse num="4"> Your words have upheld him who was stumbling, And you have strengthened the feeble knees; </verse>
			<verse num="5"> But now it comes upon you, and you are weary; It touches you, and you are troubled. </verse>
			<verse num="6"> [Is] not your reverence your confidence? And the integrity of your ways your hope? </verse>
			<verse num="7"> "Remember now, who [ever] perished being innocent? Or where were the upright [ever] cut off? </verse>
			<verse num="8"> Even as I have seen, Those who plow iniquity And sow trouble reap the same. </verse>
			<verse num="9"> By the blast of God they perish, And by the breath of His anger they are consumed. </verse>
			<verse num="10"> The roaring of the lion, The voice of the fierce lion, And the teeth of the young lions are broken. </verse>
			<verse num="11"> The old lion perishes for lack of prey, And the cubs of the lioness are scattered. </verse>
			<verse num="12"> " Now a word was secretly brought to me, And my ear received a whisper of it. </verse>
			<verse num="13"> In disquieting thoughts from the visions of the night, When deep sleep falls on men, </verse>
			<verse num="14"> Fear came upon me, and trembling, Which made all my bones shake. </verse>
			<verse num="15"> Then a spirit passed before my face; The hair on my body stood up. </verse>
			<verse num="16"> It stood still, But I could not discern its appearance. A form [was] before my eyes; [There was] silence; Then I heard a voice [saying:] </verse>
			<verse num="17"> 'Can a mortal be more righteous than God? Can a man be more pure than his Maker? </verse>
			<verse num="18"> If He puts no trust in His servants, [If] He charges His angels with error, </verse>
			<verse num="19"> How much more those who dwell in houses of clay, Whose foundation is in the dust, [Who] are crushed before a moth? </verse>
			<verse num="20"> They are broken in pieces from morning till evening; They perish forever, with no one regarding. </verse>
			<verse num="21"> Does not their own excellence go away? They die, even without wisdom.' </verse>
		</chapter>
		<chapter num="5">
			<verse num="1"> "Call out now; Is there anyone who will answer you? And to which of the holy ones will you turn? </verse>
			<verse num="2"> For wrath kills a foolish man, And envy slays a simple one. </verse>
			<verse num="3"> I have seen the foolish taking root, But suddenly I cursed his dwelling place. </verse>
			<verse num="4"> His sons are far from safety, They are crushed in the gate, And [there is] no deliverer. </verse>
			<verse num="5"> Because the hungry eat up his harvest, Taking it even from the thorns, And a snare snatches their substance. </verse>
			<verse num="6"> For affliction does not come from the dust, Nor does trouble spring from the ground; </verse>
			<verse num="7"> Yet man is born to trouble, As the sparks fly upward. </verse>
			<verse num="8"> "But as for me, I would seek God, And to God I would commit my cause -- </verse>
			<verse num="9"> Who does great things, and unsearchable, Marvelous things without number. </verse>
			<verse num="10"> He gives rain on the earth, And sends waters on the fields. </verse>
			<verse num="11"> He sets on high those who are lowly, And those who mourn are lifted to safety. </verse>
			<verse num="12"> He frustrates the devices of the crafty, So that their hands cannot carry out their plans. </verse>
			<verse num="13"> He catches the wise in their own craftiness, And the counsel of the cunning comes quickly upon them. </verse>
			<verse num="14"> They meet with darkness in the daytime, And grope at noontime as in the night. </verse>
			<verse num="15"> But He saves the needy from the sword, From the mouth of the mighty, And from their hand. </verse>
			<verse num="16"> So the poor have hope, And injustice shuts her mouth. </verse>
			<verse num="17"> " Behold, happy [is] the man whom God corrects; Therefore do not despise the chastening of the Almighty. </verse>
			<verse num="18"> For He bruises, but He binds up; He wounds, but His hands make whole. </verse>
			<verse num="19"> He shall deliver you in six troubles, Yes, in seven no evil shall touch you. </verse>
			<verse num="20"> In famine He shall redeem you from death, And in war from the power of the sword. </verse>
			<verse num="21"> You shall be hidden from the scourge of the tongue, And you shall not be afraid of destruction when it comes. </verse>
			<verse num="22"> You shall laugh at destruction and famine, And you shall not be afraid of the beasts of the earth. </verse>
			<verse num="23"> For you shall have a covenant with the stones of the field, And the beasts of the field shall be at peace with you. </verse>
			<verse num="24"> You shall know that your tent [is] in peace; You shall visit your dwelling and find nothing amiss. </verse>
			<verse num="25"> You shall also know that your descendants [shall be] many, And your offspring like the grass of the earth. </verse>
			<verse num="26"> You shall come to the grave at a full age, As a sheaf of grain ripens in its season. </verse>
			<verse num="27"> Behold, this we have searched out; It [is] true. Hear it, and know for yourself." </verse>
		</chapter>
		<chapter num="6">
			<verse num="1"> Then Job answered and said: </verse>
			<verse num="2"> "Oh, that my grief were fully weighed, And my calamity laid with it on the scales! </verse>
			<verse num="3"> For then it would be heavier than the sand of the sea -- Therefore my words have been rash. </verse>
			<verse num="4"> For the arrows of the Almighty [are] within me; My spirit drinks in their poison; The terrors of God are arrayed against me. </verse>
			<verse num="5"> Does the wild donkey bray when it has grass, Or does the ox low over its fodder? </verse>
			<verse num="6"> Can flavorless food be eaten without salt? Or is there [any] taste in the white of an egg? </verse>
			<verse num="7"> My soul refuses to touch them; They [are] as loathsome food to me. </verse>
			<verse num="8"> " Oh, that I might have my request, That God would grant [me] the thing that I long for! </verse>
			<verse num="9"> That it would please God to crush me, That He would loose His hand and cut me off! </verse>
			<verse num="10"> Then I would still have comfort; Though in anguish, I would exult, He will not spare; For I have not concealed the words of the Holy One. </verse>
			<verse num="11"> "What strength do I have, that I should hope? And what [is] my end, that I should prolong my life? </verse>
			<verse num="12"> [Is] my strength the strength of stones? Or is my flesh bronze? </verse>
			<verse num="13"> [Is] my help not within me? And is success driven from me? </verse>
			<verse num="14"> " To him who is afflicted, kindness [should be shown] by his friend, Even though he forsakes the fear of the Almighty. </verse>
			<verse num="15"> My brothers have dealt deceitfully like a brook, Like the streams of the brooks that pass away, </verse>
			<verse num="16"> Which are dark because of the ice, [And] into which the snow vanishes. </verse>
			<verse num="17"> When it is warm, they cease to flow; When it is hot, they vanish from their place. </verse>
			<verse num="18"> The paths of their way turn aside, They go nowhere and perish. </verse>
			<verse num="19"> The caravans of Tema look, The travelers of Sheba hope for them. </verse>
			<verse num="20"> They are disappointed because they were confident; They come there and are confused. </verse>
			<verse num="21"> For now you are nothing, You see terror and are afraid. </verse>
			<verse num="22"> Did I ever say, 'Bring [something] to me'? Or, 'Offer a bribe for me from your wealth'? </verse>
			<verse num="23"> Or, 'Deliver me from the enemy's hand'? Or, 'Redeem me from the hand of oppressors'? </verse>
			<verse num="24"> " Teach me, and I will hold my tongue; Cause me to understand wherein I have erred. </verse>
			<verse num="25"> How forceful are right words! But what does your arguing prove? </verse>
			<verse num="26"> Do you intend to rebuke [my] words, And the speeches of a desperate one, [which are] as wind? </verse>
			<verse num="27"> Yes, you overwhelm the fatherless, And you undermine your friend. </verse>
			<verse num="28"> Now therefore, be pleased to look at me; For I would never lie to your face. </verse>
			<verse num="29"> Yield now, let there be no injustice! Yes, concede, my righteousness still stands! </verse>
			<verse num="30"> Is there injustice on my tongue? Cannot my taste discern the unsavory? </verse>
		</chapter>
		<chapter num="7">
			<verse num="1"> "[Is there] not a time of hard service for man on earth? [Are not] his days also like the days of a hired man? </verse>
			<verse num="2"> Like a servant who earnestly desires the shade, And like a hired man who eagerly looks for his wages, </verse>
			<verse num="3"> So I have been allotted months of futility, And wearisome nights have been appointed to me. </verse>
			<verse num="4"> When I lie down, I say, 'When shall I arise, And the night be ended?' For I have had my fill of tossing till dawn. </verse>
			<verse num="5"> My flesh is caked with worms and dust, My skin is cracked and breaks out afresh. </verse>
			<verse num="6"> "My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, And are spent without hope. </verse>
			<verse num="7"> Oh, remember that my life [is] a breath! My eye will never again see good. </verse>
			<verse num="8"> The eye of him who sees me will see me no [more;] [While] your [eyes] are upon me, I shall no longer [be.] </verse>
			<verse num="9"> [As] the cloud disappears and vanishes away, So he who goes down to the grave does not come up. </verse>
			<verse num="10"> He shall never return to his house, Nor shall his place know him anymore. </verse>
			<verse num="11"> " Therefore I will not restrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul. </verse>
			<verse num="12"> [Am] I a sea, or a sea serpent, That You set a guard over me? </verse>
			<verse num="13"> When I say, 'My bed will comfort me, My couch will ease my complaint,' </verse>
			<verse num="14"> Then You scare me with dreams And terrify me with visions, </verse>
			<verse num="15"> So that my soul chooses strangling [And] death rather than my body. </verse>
			<verse num="16"> I loathe [my life;] I would not live forever. Let me alone, For my days [are but] a breath. </verse>
			<verse num="17"> "What [is] man, that You should exalt him, [That] You should set Your heart on him, </verse>
			<verse num="18"> That You should visit him every morning, [And] test him every moment? </verse>
			<verse num="19"> How long? Will You not look away from me, And let me alone till I swallow my saliva? </verse>
			<verse num="20"> Have I sinned? What have I done to You, O watcher of men? Why have You set me as Your target, So that I am a burden to myself? </verse>
			<verse num="21"> Why then do You not pardon my transgression, And take away my iniquity? For now I will lie down in the dust, And You will seek me diligently, But I [will] no longer [be."] </verse>
		</chapter>
		<chapter num="8">
			<verse num="1"> Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said: </verse>
			<verse num="2"> "How long will you speak these [things,] And the words of your mouth [be like] a strong wind? </verse>
			<verse num="3"> Does God subvert judgment? Or does the Almighty pervert justice? </verse>
			<verse num="4"> If your sons have sinned against Him, He has cast them away for their transgression. </verse>
			<verse num="5"> If you would earnestly seek God And make your supplication to the Almighty, </verse>
			<verse num="6"> If you [were] pure and upright, Surely now He would awake for you, And prosper your rightful dwelling place. </verse>
			<verse num="7"> Though your beginning was small, Yet your latter end would increase abundantly. </verse>
			<verse num="8"> "For inquire, please, of the former age, And consider the things discovered by their fathers; </verse>
			<verse num="9"> For we [were born] yesterday, and know nothing, Because our days on earth [are] a shadow. </verse>
			<verse num="10"> Will they not teach you and tell you, And utter words from their heart? </verse>
			<verse num="11"> " Can the papyrus grow up without a marsh? Can the reeds flourish without water? </verse>
			<verse num="12"> While it [is] yet green [and] not cut down, It withers before any [other] plant. </verse>
			<verse num="13"> So [are] the paths of all who forget God; And the hope of the hypocrite shall perish, </verse>
			<verse num="14"> Whose confidence shall be cut off, And whose trust [is] a spider's web. </verse>
			<verse num="15"> He leans on his house, but it does not stand. He holds it fast, but it does not endure. </verse>
			<verse num="16"> He grows green in the sun, And his branches spread out in his garden. </verse>
			<verse num="17"> His roots wrap around the rock heap, [And] look for a place in the stones. </verse>
			<verse num="18"> If he is destroyed from his place, Then [it] will deny him, [saying,] 'I have not seen you.' </verse>
			<verse num="19"> " Behold, this is the joy of His way, And out of the earth others will grow. </verse>
			<verse num="20"> Behold, God will not cast away the blameless, Nor will He uphold the evildoers. </verse>
			<verse num="21"> He will yet fill your mouth with laughing, And your lips with rejoicing. </verse>
			<verse num="22"> Those who hate you will be clothed with shame, And the dwelling place of the wicked will come to nothing." </verse>
		</chapter>
		<chapter num="9">
			<verse num="1"> Then Job answered and said: </verse>
			<verse num="2"> "Truly I know [it is] so, But how can a man be righteous before God? </verse>
			<verse num="3"> If one wished to contend with Him, He could not answer Him one time out of a thousand. </verse>
			<verse num="4"> God [is] wise in heart and mighty in strength. Who has hardened [himself] against Him and prospered? </verse>
			<verse num="5"> He removes the mountains, and they do not know When He overturns them in His anger; </verse>
			<verse num="6"> He shakes the earth out of its place, And its pillars tremble; </verse>
			<verse num="7"> He commands the sun, and it does not rise; He seals off the stars; </verse>
			<verse num="8"> He alone spreads out the heavens, And treads on the waves of the sea; </verse>
			<verse num="9"> He made the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades, And the chambers of the south; </verse>
			<verse num="10"> He does great things past finding out, Yes, wonders without number. </verse>
			<verse num="11"> If He goes by me, I do not see [Him;] If He moves past, I do not perceive Him; </verse>
			<verse num="12"> If He takes away, who can hinder Him? Who can say to Him, 'What are You doing?' </verse>
			<verse num="13"> God will not withdraw His anger, The allies of the proud lie prostrate beneath Him. </verse>
			<verse num="14"> " How then can I answer Him, [And] choose my words [to reason] with Him? </verse>
			<verse num="15"> For though I were righteous, I could not answer Him; I would beg mercy of my Judge. </verse>
			<verse num="16"> If I called and He answered me, I would not believe that He was listening to my voice. </verse>
			<verse num="17"> For He crushes me with a tempest, And multiplies my wounds without cause. </verse>
			<verse num="18"> He will not allow me to catch my breath, But fills me with bitterness. </verse>
			<verse num="19"> If [it is a matter] of strength, indeed [He is] strong; And if of justice, who will appoint my day [in court?] </verse>
			<verse num="20"> Though I were righteous, my own mouth would condemn me; Though I [were] blameless, it would prove me perverse. </verse>
			<verse num="21"> "I am blameless, yet I do not know myself; I despise my life. </verse>
			<verse num="22"> It [is] all one [thing;] Therefore I say, 'He destroys the blameless and the wicked.' </verse>
			<verse num="23"> If the scourge slays suddenly, He laughs at the plight of the innocent. </verse>
			<verse num="24"> The earth is given into the hand of the wicked. He covers the faces of its judges. If it is not [He,] who else could it be? </verse>
			<verse num="25"> "Now my days are swifter than a runner; They flee away, they see no good. </verse>
			<verse num="26"> They pass by like swift ships, Like an eagle swooping on its prey. </verse>
			<verse num="27"> If I say, 'I will forget my complaint, I will put off my sad face and wear a smile,' </verse>
			<verse num="28"> I am afraid of all my sufferings; I know that You will not hold me innocent. </verse>
			<verse num="29"> [If] I am condemned, Why then do I labor in vain? </verse>
			<verse num="30"> If I wash myself with snow water, And cleanse my hands with soap, </verse>
			<verse num="31"> Yet You will plunge me into the pit, And my own clothes will abhor me. </verse>
			<verse num="32"> "For [He is] not a man, as I [am,] [That] I may answer Him, [And that] we should go to court together. </verse>
			<verse num="33"> Nor is there any mediator between us, [Who] may lay his hand on us both. </verse>
			<verse num="34"> Let Him take His rod away from me, And do not let dread of Him terrify me. </verse>
			<verse num="35"> [Then] I would speak and not fear Him, But it is not so with me. </verse>
		</chapter>
		<chapter num="10">
			<verse num="1"> "My soul loathes my life; I will give free course to my complaint, I will speak in the bitterness of my soul. </verse>
			<verse num="2"> I will say to God, 'Do not condemn me; Show me why You contend with me. </verse>
			<verse num="3"> [Does it] seem good to You that You should oppress, That You should despise the work of Your hands, And smile on the counsel of the wicked? </verse>
			<verse num="4"> Do You have eyes of flesh? Or do You see as man sees? </verse>
			<verse num="5"> [Are] Your days like the days of a mortal man? [Are] Your years like the days of a mighty man, </verse>
			<verse num="6"> That You should seek for my iniquity And search out my sin, </verse>
			<verse num="7"> Although You know that I am not wicked, And [there is] no one who can deliver from Your hand? </verse>
			<verse num="8"> 'Your hands have made me and fashioned me, An intricate unity; Yet You would destroy me. </verse>
			<verse num="9"> Remember, I pray, that You have made me like clay. And will You turn me into dust again? </verse>
			<verse num="10"> Did you not pour me out like milk, And curdle me like cheese, </verse>

			<verse num="1"> So these three men ceased answering Job, because he [was] righteous in his own eyes. </verse>
			<verse num="2"> Then the wrath of Elihu, the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, was aroused against Job; his wrath was aroused because he justified himself rather than God. </verse>
			<verse num="3"> Also against his three friends his wrath was aroused, because they had found no answer, and [yet] had condemned Job. </verse>
			<verse num="4"> Now because they [were] years older than he, Elihu had waited to speak to Job. </verse>
			<verse num="5"> When Elihu saw that [there was] no answer in the mouth of these three men, his wrath was aroused. </verse>
			<verse num="6"> So Elihu, the son of Barachel the Buzite, answered and said: "I [am] young in years, and you [are] very old; Therefore I was afraid, And dared not declare my opinion to you. </verse>
			<verse num="7"> I said, 'Age should speak, And multitude of years should teach wisdom.' </verse>
			<verse num="8"> But [there is] a spirit in man, And the breath of the Almighty gives him understanding. </verse>
			<verse num="9"> Great men are not [always] wise, Nor do the aged [always] understand justice. </verse>
			<verse num="10"> "Therefore I say, 'Listen to me, I also will declare my opinion.' </verse>
			<verse num="11"> Indeed I waited for your words, I listened to your reasonings, while you searched out what to say. </verse>
			<verse num="12"> I paid close attention to you; And surely not one of you convinced Job, [Or] answered his words -- </verse>
			<verse num="13"> Lest you say, 'We have found wisdom'; God will vanquish him, not man. </verse>
			<verse num="14"> Now he has not directed [his] words against me; So I will not answer him with your words. </verse>
			<verse num="15"> " They are dismayed and answer no more; Words escape them. </verse>
			<verse num="16"> And I have waited, because they did not speak, Because they stood still [and] answered no more. </verse>
			<verse num="17"> I also will answer my part, I too will declare my opinion. </verse>
			<verse num="18"> For I am full of words; The spirit within me compels me. </verse>
			<verse num="19"> Indeed my belly [is] like wine [that] has no vent; It is ready to burst like new wineskins. </verse>
			<verse num="20"> I will speak, that I may find relief; I must open my lips and answer. </verse>
			<verse num="21"> Let me not, I pray, show partiality to anyone; Nor let me flatter any man. </verse>

			<verse num="23"> " If there is a messenger for him, A mediator, one among a thousand, To show man His uprightness, </verse>
			<verse num="24"> Then He is gracious to him, and says, 'Deliver him from going down to the Pit; I have found a ransom'; </verse>
			<verse num="25"> His flesh shall be young like a child's, He shall return to the days of his youth. </verse>
			<verse num="26"> He shall pray to God, and He will delight in him, He shall see His face with joy, For He restores to man His righteousness. </verse>
			<verse num="27"> Then he looks at men and says, 'I have sinned, and perverted [what was] right, And it did not profit me.' </verse>

		<chapter num="34">
			<verse num="1"> Elihu further answered and said: </verse>
			<verse num="2"> "Hear my words, you wise [men;] Give ear to me, you who have knowledge. </verse>
			<verse num="3"> For the ear tests words As the palate tastes food. </verse>
			<verse num="4"> Let us choose justice for ourselves; Let us know among ourselves what [is] good. </verse>
			<verse num="5"> "For Job has said, 'I am righteous, But God has taken away my justice; </verse>
			<verse num="6"> Should I lie concerning my right? My wound [is] incurable, [though I am] without transgression.' </verse>
			<verse num="7"> What man [is] like Job, [Who] drinks scorn like water, </verse>
			<verse num="8"> Who goes in company with the workers of iniquity, And walks with wicked men? </verse>
			<verse num="9"> For he has said, 'It profits a man nothing That he should delight in God.' </verse>
			<verse num="10"> " Therefore listen to me, you men of understanding: Far be it from God [to do] wickedness, And [from] the Almighty to [commit] iniquity. </verse>
			<verse num="11"> For He repays man [according to] his work, And makes man to find a reward according to [his] way. </verse>
			<verse num="12"> Surely God will never do wickedly, Nor will the Almighty pervert justice. </verse>
			<verse num="13"> Who gave Him charge over the earth? Or who appointed [Him over] the whole world? </verse>
			<verse num="14"> If He should set His heart on it, [If] He should gather to Himself His Spirit and His breath, </verse>
			<verse num="15"> All flesh would perish together, And man would return to dust. </verse>
			<verse num="16"> "If [you have] understanding, hear this; listen to the sound of my words: </verse>

			<verse num="18"> [Is it fitting] to say to a king, '[You are] worthless,' [And] to nobles, '[You are] wicked'? </verse>
			<verse num="19"> Yet He is not partial to princes, Nor does He regard the rich more than the poor; For they [are] all the work of His hands. </verse>
			<verse num="20"> In a moment they die, in the middle of the night; The people are shaken and pass away; The mighty are taken away without a hand. </verse>
			<verse num="21"> "For His eyes [are] on the ways of man, And He sees all his steps. </verse>
			<verse num="22"> There is no darkness nor shadow of death Where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves. </verse>
			<verse num="23"> For He need not further consider a man, That he should go before God in judgment. </verse>
			<verse num="24"> He breaks in pieces mighty men without inquiry, And sets others in their place. </verse>
			<verse num="25"> Therefore he knows their works; He overthrows [them] in the night, And they are crushed. </verse>
			<verse num="26"> He strikes them as wicked [men] In the open sight of others, </verse>
			<verse num="27"> Because they turned back from Him, And would not consider any of His ways, </verse>
			<verse num="28"> So that they caused the cry of the poor to come to Him; For He hears the cry of the afflicted. </verse>
			<verse num="29"> When He gives quietness, who then can make trouble? And when He hides [His] face, who then can see Him, Whether [it is] against a nation or a man alone? -- </verse>
			<verse num="30"> That the hypocrite should not reign, Lest the people be ensnared. </verse>
			<verse num="31"> " For has [anyone] said to God, 'I have borne [chastening;] I will offend no more; </verse>
			<verse num="32"> Teach me [what] I do not see; If I have done iniquity, I will do no more'? </verse>
			<verse num="33"> Should He repay [it] according to your [terms,] [Just] because you disavow it? You must choose, and not I; Therefore speak what you know. </verse>
			<verse num="34"> "Men of understanding say to me, Wise men who listen to me: </verse>
			<verse num="35"> 'Job speaks without knowledge, His words [are] without wisdom.' </verse>
			<verse num="36"> Oh, that Job were tried to the utmost, Because [his] answers [are like] those of wicked men! </verse>
			<verse num="37"> For he adds rebellion to his sin; He claps [his hands] among us, And multiplies his words against God." </verse>
		</chapter>
		<chapter num="35">
			<verse num="1"> Moreover Elihu answered and said: </verse>
			<verse num="2"> "Do you think this is right? Do you say, 'My righteousness is more than God's'? </verse>
			<verse num="3"> For you say, 'What advantage will it be to You? What profit shall I have, more than [if] I had sinned?' </verse>
			<verse num="4"> " I will answer you, And your companions with you. </verse>
			<verse num="5"> Look to the heavens and see; And behold the clouds -- They are higher than you. </verse>
			<verse num="6"> If you sin, what do you accomplish against Him? Or, [if] your transgressions are multiplied, what do you do to Him? </verse>
			<verse num="7"> If you are righteous, what do you give Him? Or what does He receive from your hand? </verse>
			<verse num="8"> Your wickedness affects a man such as you, And your righteousness a son of man. </verse>
			<verse num="9"> "Because of the multitude of oppressions they cry out; They cry out for help because of the arm of the mighty. </verse>
			<verse num="10"> But no one says, 'Where [is] God my Maker, Who gives songs in the night, </verse>
			<verse num="11"> Who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth, And makes us wiser than the birds of heaven?' </verse>
			<verse num="12"> There they cry out, but He does not answer, Because of the pride of evil men. </verse>
			<verse num="13"> Surely God will not listen to empty [talk,] Nor will the Almighty regard it. </verse>
			<verse num="14"> Although you say you do not see Him, [Yet] justice [is] before Him, and you must wait for Him. </verse>
			<verse num="15"> And now, because He has not punished in His anger, Nor taken much notice of folly, </verse>
			<verse num="16"> Therefore Job opens his mouth in vain; He multiplies words without knowledge." </verse>
		</chapter>
		<chapter num="36">
			<verse num="1"> Elihu also proceeded and said: </verse>
			<verse num="2"> "Bear with me a little, and I will show you That [there are] yet words to speak on God's behalf. </verse>
			<verse num="3"> I will fetch my knowledge from afar; I will ascribe righteousness to my Maker. </verse>
			<verse num="4"> For truly my words [are] not false; One who is perfect in knowledge [is] with you. </verse>
			<verse num="5"> "Behold, God [is] mighty, but despises [no one;] [He is] mighty in strength of understanding. </verse>
			<verse num="6"> He does not preserve the life of the wicked, But gives justice to the oppressed. </verse>
			<verse num="7"> He does not withdraw His eyes from the righteous; But [they are] on the throne with kings, For He has seated them forever, And they are exalted. </verse>
			<verse num="8"> And if [they are] bound in fetters, Held in the cords of affliction, </verse>
			<verse num="9"> Then He tells them their work and their transgressions -- That they have acted defiantly. </verse>
			<verse num="10"> He also opens their ear to instruction, And commands that they turn from iniquity. </verse>
			<verse num="11"> If they obey and serve [Him,] They shall spend their days in prosperity, And their years in pleasures. </verse>
			<verse num="12"> But if they do not obey, They shall perish by the sword, And they shall die without knowledge. </verse>
			<verse num="13"> " But the hypocrites in heart store up wrath; They do not cry for help when He binds them. </verse>
			<verse num="14"> They die in youth, And their life [ends] among the perverted persons. </verse>
			<verse num="15"> He delivers the poor in their affliction, And opens their ears in oppression. </verse>
			<verse num="16"> "Indeed He would have brought you out of dire distress, [Into] a broad place where [there is] no restraint; And what is set on your table [would be] full of richness. </verse>
			<verse num="17"> But you are filled with the judgment due the wicked; Judgment and justice take hold [of you.] </verse>
			<verse num="18"> Because [there is] wrath, [beware] lest He take you away with [one] blow; For a large ransom would not help you avoid [it.] </verse>
			<verse num="19"> Will your riches, Or all the mighty forces, Keep you from distress? </verse>
			<verse num="20"> Do not desire the night, When people are cut off in their place. </verse>
			<verse num="21"> Take heed, do not turn to iniquity, For you have chosen this rather than affliction. </verse>
			<verse num="22"> " Behold, God is exalted by His power; Who teaches like Him? </verse>

			<verse num="8"> "Would you indeed annul My judgment? Would you condemn Me that you may be justified? </verse>

			<verse num="24"> His heart is as hard as stone, Even as hard as the lower [millstone.] </verse>
			<verse num="25"> When he raises himself up, the mighty are afraid; Because of his crashings they are beside themselves. </verse>
			<verse num="26"> [Though] the sword reaches him, it cannot avail; Nor does spear, dart, or javelin. </verse>
			<verse num="27"> He regards iron as straw, [And] bronze as rotten wood. </verse>
			<verse num="28"> The arrow cannot make him flee; Slingstones become like stubble to him. </verse>
			<verse num="29"> Darts are regarded as straw; He laughs at the threat of javelins. </verse>
			<verse num="30"> His undersides [are] like sharp potsherds; He spreads pointed [marks] in the mire. </verse>
			<verse num="31"> He makes the deep boil like a pot; He makes the sea like a pot of ointment. </verse>
			<verse num="32"> He leaves a shining wake behind him; [One] would think the deep had white hair. </verse>
			<verse num="33"> On earth there is nothing like him, Which is made without fear. </verse>

			<verse num="1"> Then Job answered the LORD and said: </verse>
			<verse num="2"> "I know that You can do everything, And that no purpose [of Yours] can be withheld from You. </verse>
			<verse num="3"> [You asked,] 'Who [is] this who hides counsel without knowledge?' Therefore I have uttered what I did not understand, Things too wonderful for me, which I did not know. </verse>
			<verse num="4"> Listen, please, and let me speak; [You said,] 'I will question you, and you shall answer Me.' </verse>
			<verse num="5"> "I have heard of You by the hearing of the ear, But now my eye sees You. </verse>
			<verse num="6"> Therefore I abhor [myself,] And repent in dust and ashes." </verse>
			<verse num="7"> And so it was, after the LORD had spoken these words to Job, that the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, "My wrath is aroused against you and your two friends, for you have not spoken of Me [what is] right, as My servant Job [has.] </verse>
			<verse num="8"> "Now therefore, take for yourselves seven bulls and seven rams, go to My servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and My servant Job shall pray for you. For I will accept him, lest I deal with you [according to your] folly; because you have not spoken of Me [what is] right, as My servant Job [has."] </verse>
			<verse num="9"> So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite [and] Zophar the Naamathite went and did as the LORD commanded them; for the LORD had accepted Job. </verse>
			<verse num="10"> And the LORD restored Job's losses when he prayed for his friends. Indeed the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before. </verse>
			<verse num="11"> Then all his brothers, all his sisters, and all those who had been his acquaintances before, came to him and ate food with him in his house; and they consoled him and comforted him for all the adversity that the LORD had brought upon him. Each one gave him a piece of silver and each a ring of gold. </verse>
			<verse num="12"> Now the LORD blessed the latter [days] of Job more than his beginning; for he had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, one thousand yoke of oxen, and one thousand female donkeys. </verse>
			<verse num="13"> He also had seven sons and three daughters. </verse>
			<verse num="14"> And he called the name of the first Jemimah, the name of the second Keziah, and the name of the third Keren-Happuch. </verse>
			<verse num="15"> In all the land were found no women [so] beautiful as the daughters of Job; and their father gave them an inheritance among their brothers. </verse>
			<verse num="16"> After this Job lived one hundred and forty years, and saw his children and grandchildren [for] four generations. </verse>
			<verse num="17"> So Job died, old and full of days. </verse>
