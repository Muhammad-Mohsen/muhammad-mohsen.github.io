			<verse num="1"> Blessed [is] the man Who walks not in the counsel of the ungodly, Nor stands in the path of sinners, Nor sits in the seat of the scornful; </verse>
			<verse num="2"> But his delight [is] in the law of the LORD, And in His law he meditates day and night. </verse>
			<verse num="3"> He shall be like a tree Planted by the rivers of water, That brings forth its fruit in its season, Whose leaf also shall not wither; And whatever he does shall prosper. </verse>
			<verse num="4"> The ungodly [are] not so, But [are] like the chaff which the wind drives away. </verse>
			<verse num="5"> Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, Nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous. </verse>
			<verse num="6"> For the LORD knows the way of the righteous, But the way of the ungodly shall perish. </verse>

		<chapter num="2">
			<verse num="1"> Why do the nations rage, And the people plot a vain thing? </verse>
			<verse num="2"> The kings of the earth set themselves, And the rulers take counsel together, Against the LORD and against His Anointed, [saying,] </verse>
			<verse num="3"> "Let us break Their bonds in pieces And cast away Their cords from us." </verse>
			<verse num="4"> He who sits in the heavens shall laugh; The LORD shall hold them in derision. </verse>
			<verse num="5"> Then He shall speak to them in His wrath, And distress them in His deep displeasure: </verse>
			<verse num="6"> "Yet I have set My King On My holy hill of Zion." </verse>
			<verse num="7"> "I will declare the decree: The LORD has said to Me, 'You [are] My Son, Today I have begotten You. </verse>
			<verse num="8"> Ask of Me, and I will give [You] The nations [for] Your inheritance, And the ends of the earth [for] Your possession. </verse>
			<verse num="9"> You shall break them with a rod of iron; You shall dash them to pieces like a potter's vessel.' " </verse>
			<verse num="10"> Now therefore, be wise, O kings; Be instructed, you judges of the earth. </verse>
			<verse num="11"> Serve the LORD with fear, And rejoice with trembling. </verse>
			<verse num="12"> Kiss the Son, lest He be angry, And you perish [in] the way, When His wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed [are] all those who put their trust in Him. </verse>

			<verse num="3"> My voice You shall hear in the morning, O LORD; In the morning I will direct [it] to You, And I will look up. </verse>
			<verse num="4"> For You [are] not a God who takes pleasure in wickedness, Nor shall evil dwell with You. </verse>
			<verse num="5"> The boastful shall not stand in Your sight; You hate all workers of iniquity. </verse>
			<verse num="6"> You shall destroy those who speak falsehood; The LORD abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful man. </verse>

			<verse num="8"> Lead me, O LORD, in Your righteousness because of my enemies; Make Your way straight before my face. </verse>
			<verse num="9"> For [there is] no faithfulness in their mouth; Their inward part [is] destruction; Their throat [is] an open tomb; They flatter with their tongue. </verse>
			<verse num="10"> Pronounce them guilty, O God! Let them fall by their own counsels; Cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions, For they have rebelled against You. </verse>

			<verse num="10"> My defense [is] of God, Who saves the upright in heart. </verse>
			<verse num="11"> God [is] a just judge, And God is angry [with the wicked] every day. </verse>

		<chapter num="18">
			<verse num="1"> To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David the servant of the LORD, who spoke to the LORD the words of this song on the day that the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul. And he said: I will love You, O LORD, my strength. </verse>
			<verse num="2"> The LORD is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer; My God, my strength, in whom I will trust; My shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold. </verse>
			<verse num="3"> I will call upon the LORD, [who is worthy] to be praised; So shall I be saved from my enemies. </verse>
			<verse num="4"> The pangs of death surrounded me, And the floods of ungodliness made me afraid. </verse>
			<verse num="5"> The sorrows of Sheol surrounded me; The snares of death confronted me. </verse>
			<verse num="6"> In my distress I called upon the LORD, And cried out to my God; He heard my voice from His temple, And my cry came before Him, [even] to His ears. </verse>
			<verse num="7"> Then the earth shook and trembled; The foundations of the hills also quaked and were shaken, Because He was angry. </verse>
			<verse num="8"> Smoke went up from His nostrils, And devouring fire from His mouth; Coals were kindled by it. </verse>
			<verse num="9"> He bowed the heavens also, and came down With darkness under His feet. </verse>

			<verse num="15"> Then the channels of the sea were seen, The foundations of the world were uncovered At Your rebuke, O LORD, At the blast of the breath of Your nostrils. </verse>
			<verse num="16"> He sent from above, He took me; He drew me out of many waters. </verse>

			<verse num="19"> He also brought me out into a broad place; He delivered me because He delighted in me. </verse>
			<verse num="20"> The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; According to the cleanness of my hands He has recompensed me. </verse>

			<verse num="33"> He makes my feet like the [feet of] deer, And sets me on my high places. </verse>
			<verse num="34"> He teaches my hands to make war, So that my arms can bend a bow of bronze. </verse>
			<verse num="35"> You have also given me the shield of Your salvation; Your right hand has held me up, Your gentleness has made me great. </verse>

			<verse num="44"> Turned their rivers into blood, And their streams, that they could not drink. </verse>
			<verse num="45"> He sent swarms of flies among them, which devoured them, And frogs, which destroyed them. </verse>
			<verse num="46"> He also gave their crops to the caterpillar, And their labor to the locust. </verse>
			<verse num="47"> He destroyed their vines with hail, And their sycamore trees with frost. </verse>
			<verse num="48"> He also gave up their cattle to the hail, And their flocks to fiery lightning. </verse>
			<verse num="49"> He cast on them the fierceness of His anger, Wrath, indignation, and trouble, By sending angels of destruction [among them.] </verse>
			<verse num="50"> He made a path for His anger; He did not spare their soul from death, But gave their life over to the plague, </verse>
			<verse num="51"> And destroyed all the firstborn in Egypt, The first of [their] strength in the tents of Ham. </verse>
			<verse num="52"> But He made His own people go forth like sheep, And guided them in the wilderness like a flock; </verse>
			<verse num="53"> And He led them on safely, so that they did not fear; But the sea overwhelmed their enemies. </verse>
			<verse num="54"> And He brought them to His holy border, This mountain [which] His right hand had acquired. </verse>
			<verse num="55"> He also drove out the nations before them, Allotted them an inheritance by survey, And made the tribes of Israel dwell in their tents. </verse>
			<verse num="56"> Yet they tested and provoked the Most High God, And did not keep His testimonies, </verse>
			<verse num="57"> But turned back and acted unfaithfully like their fathers; They were turned aside like a deceitful bow. </verse>
			<verse num="58"> For they provoked Him to anger with their high places, And moved Him to jealousy with their carved images. </verse>
			<verse num="59"> When God heard [this,] He was furious, And greatly abhorred Israel, </verse>
			<verse num="60"> So that He forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, The tent He had placed among men, </verse>
			<verse num="61"> And delivered His strength into captivity, And His glory into the enemy's hand. </verse>
			<verse num="62"> He also gave His people over to the sword, And was furious with His inheritance. </verse>
			<verse num="63"> The fire consumed their young men, And their maidens were not given in marriage. </verse>
			<verse num="64"> Their priests fell by the sword, And their widows made no lamentation. </verse>
			<verse num="65"> Then the Lord awoke as [from] sleep, Like a mighty man who shouts because of wine. </verse>
			<verse num="66"> And He beat back His enemies; He put them to a perpetual reproach. </verse>
			<verse num="67"> Moreover He rejected the tent of Joseph, And did not choose the tribe of Ephraim, </verse>
			<verse num="68"> But chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion which He loved. </verse>
			<verse num="69"> And He built His sanctuary like the heights, Like the earth which He has established forever. </verse>
			<verse num="70"> He also chose David His servant, And took him from the sheepfolds; </verse>
			<verse num="71"> From following the ewes that had young He brought him, To shepherd Jacob His people, And Israel His inheritance. </verse>
