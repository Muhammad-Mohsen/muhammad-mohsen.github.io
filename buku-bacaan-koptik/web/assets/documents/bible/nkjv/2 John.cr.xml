			<verse num="1"> THE ELDER, To the elect lady and her children, whom I love in truth, and not only I, but also all those who have known the truth, </verse>
			<verse num="2"> because of the truth which abides in us and will be with us forever: </verse>
			<verse num="3"> Grace, mercy, [and] peace will be with you from God the Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love. </verse>
			<verse num="4"> I rejoiced greatly that I have found [some] of your children walking in truth, as we received commandment from the Father. </verse>
			<verse num="5"> And now I plead with you, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment to you, but that which we have had from the beginning: that we love one another. </verse>
			<verse num="6"> This is love, that we walk according to His commandments. This is the commandment, that as you have heard from the beginning, you should walk in it. </verse>
			<verse num="7"> For many deceivers have gone out into the world who do not confess Jesus Christ [as] coming in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist. </verse>
			<verse num="8"> Look to yourselves, that we do not lose those things we worked for, but [that] we may receive a full reward. </verse>
			<verse num="9"> Whoever transgresses and does not abide in the doctrine of Christ does not have God. He who abides in the doctrine of Christ has both the Father and the Son. </verse>
			<verse num="10"> If anyone comes to you and does not bring this doctrine, do not receive him into your house nor greet him; </verse>
			<verse num="11"> for he who greets him shares in his evil deeds. </verse>
			<verse num="12"> Having many things to write to you, I did not wish [to do so] with paper and ink; but I hope to come to you and speak face to face, that our joy may be full. </verse>
			<verse num="13"> The children of your elect sister greet you. Amen. </verse>
