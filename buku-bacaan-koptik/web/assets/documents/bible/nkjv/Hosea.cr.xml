			<verse num="1"> The word of the LORD that came to Hosea the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, [and] Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel. </verse>
			<verse num="2"> [When] the LORD began to speak by Hosea, the LORD said to Hosea: "Go, take yourself a wife of harlotry And children of harlotry, For the land has committed great harlotry [By departing] from the LORD." </verse>
			<verse num="3"> So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim, and she conceived and bore him a son. </verse>
			<verse num="4"> Then the LORD said to him: "Call his name Jezreel, For in a little [while] I will avenge the bloodshed of Jezreel on the house of Jehu, And bring an end to the kingdom of the house of Israel. </verse>
			<verse num="5"> It shall come to pass in that day That I will break the bow of Israel in the Valley of Jezreel." </verse>
			<verse num="6"> And she conceived again and bore a daughter. Then [God] said to him: "Call her name Lo-Ruhamah, For I will no longer have mercy on the house of Israel, But I will utterly take them away. </verse>
			<verse num="7"> Yet I will have mercy on the house of Judah, Will save them by the LORD their God, And will not save them by bow, Nor by sword or battle, By horses or horsemen." </verse>
			<verse num="8"> Now when she had weaned Lo-Ruhamah, she conceived and bore a son. </verse>
			<verse num="9"> Then [God] said: "Call his name Lo-Ammi, For you [are] not My people, And I will not be your [God.] </verse>
			<verse num="10"> " Yet the number of the children of Israel Shall be as the sand of the sea, Which cannot be measured or numbered. And it shall come to pass In the place where it was said to them, 'You [are] not My people,' [There] it shall be said to them, '[You are] sons of the living God.' </verse>
			<verse num="11"> Then the children of Judah and the children of Israel Shall be gathered together, And appoint for themselves one head; And they shall come up out of the land, For great [will be] the day of Jezreel! </verse>

		<chapter num="2">
			<verse num="1"> Say to your brethren, 'My people,' And to your sisters, 'Mercy [is shown.'] </verse>
			<verse num="2"> " Bring charges against your mother, bring charges; For she [is] not My wife, nor [am] I her Husband! Let her put away her harlotries from her sight, And her adulteries from between her breasts; </verse>
			<verse num="3"> Lest I strip her naked And expose her, as in the day she was born, And make her like a wilderness, And set her like a dry land, And slay her with thirst. </verse>
			<verse num="4"> "I will not have mercy on her children, For they [are] the children of harlotry. </verse>
			<verse num="5"> For their mother has played the harlot; She who conceived them has behaved shamefully. For she said, 'I will go after my lovers, Who give [me] my bread and my water, My wool and my linen, My oil and my drink.' </verse>
			<verse num="6"> " Therefore, behold, I will hedge up your way with thorns, And wall her in, So that she cannot find her paths. </verse>
			<verse num="7"> She will chase her lovers, But not overtake them; Yes, she will seek them, but not find [them.] Then she will say, 'I will go and return to my first husband, For then [it was] better for me than now.' </verse>
			<verse num="8"> For she did not know That I gave her grain, new wine, and oil, And multiplied her silver and gold -- [Which] they prepared for Baal. </verse>
			<verse num="9"> " Therefore I will return and take away My grain in its time And My new wine in its season, And will take back My wool and My linen, [Given] to cover her nakedness. </verse>
			<verse num="10"> Now I will uncover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, And no one shall deliver her from My hand. </verse>
			<verse num="11"> I will also cause all her mirth to cease, Her feast days, Her New Moons, Her Sabbaths -- All her appointed feasts. </verse>
			<verse num="12"> "And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, Of which she has said, 'These [are] my wages that my lovers have given me.' So I will make them a forest, And the beasts of the field shall eat them. </verse>
			<verse num="13"> I will punish her For the days of the Baals to which she burned incense. She decked herself with her earrings and jewelry, And went after her lovers; But Me she forgot," says the LORD. </verse>
			<verse num="14"> " Therefore, behold, I will allure her, Will bring her into the wilderness, And speak comfort to her. </verse>
			<verse num="15"> I will give her her vineyards from there, And the Valley of Achor as a door of hope; She shall sing there, As in the days of her youth, As in the day when she came up from the land of Egypt. </verse>
			<verse num="16"> "And it shall be, in that day," Says the LORD, "[That] you will call Me 'My Husband,' And no longer call Me 'My Master,' </verse>
			<verse num="17"> For I will take from her mouth the names of the Baals, And they shall be remembered by their name no more. </verse>
			<verse num="18"> In that day I will make a covenant for them With the beasts of the field, With the birds of the air, And [with] the creeping things of the ground. Bow and sword of battle I will shatter from the earth, To make them lie down safely. </verse>
			<verse num="19"> "I will betroth you to Me forever; Yes, I will betroth you to Me In righteousness and justice, In lovingkindness and mercy; </verse>
			<verse num="20"> I will betroth you to Me in faithfulness, And you shall know the LORD. </verse>
			<verse num="21"> " It shall come to pass in that day [That] I will answer," says the LORD; "I will answer the heavens, And they shall answer the earth. </verse>
			<verse num="22"> The earth shall answer With grain, With new wine, And with oil; They shall answer Jezreel. </verse>
			<verse num="23"> Then I will sow her for Myself in the earth, And I will have mercy on [her who had] not obtained mercy; Then I will say to [those who were] not My people, 'You [are] My people!' And they shall say, '[You are] my God!' " </verse>

		<chapter num="3">
			<verse num="1"> Then the LORD said to me, "Go again, love a woman [who is] loved by a lover and is committing adultery, just like the love of the LORD for the children of Israel, who look to other gods and love [the] raisin cakes [of the pagans."] </verse>
			<verse num="2"> So I bought her for myself for fifteen [shekels] of silver, and one and one-half homers of barley. </verse>
			<verse num="3"> And I said to her, "You shall stay with me many days; you shall not play the harlot, nor shall you have a man -- so, too, [will] I [be] toward you." </verse>
			<verse num="4"> For the children of Israel shall abide many days without king or prince, without sacrifice or sacred pillar, without ephod or teraphim. </verse>
			<verse num="5"> Afterward the children of Israel shall return and seek the LORD their God and David their king. They shall fear the LORD and His goodness in the latter days. </verse>
		</chapter>
		<chapter num="4">
			<verse num="1"> Hear the word of the LORD, You children of Israel, For the LORD [brings] a charge against the inhabitants of the land: "There is no truth or mercy Or knowledge of God in the land. </verse>
			<verse num="2"> [By] swearing and lying, Killing and stealing and committing adultery, They break all restraint, With bloodshed upon bloodshed. </verse>
			<verse num="3"> Therefore the land will mourn; And everyone who dwells there will waste away With the beasts of the field And the birds of the air; Even the fish of the sea will be taken away. </verse>
			<verse num="4"> "Now let no man contend, or rebuke another; For your people [are] like those who contend with the priest. </verse>
			<verse num="5"> Therefore you shall stumble in the day; The prophet also shall stumble with you in the night; And I will destroy your mother. </verse>
			<verse num="6"> My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. Because you have rejected knowledge, I also will reject you from being priest for Me; Because you have forgotten the law of your God, I also will forget your children. </verse>
			<verse num="7"> " The more they increased, The more they sinned against Me; I will change their glory into shame. </verse>
			<verse num="8"> They eat up the sin of My people; They set their heart on their iniquity. </verse>
			<verse num="9"> And it shall be: like people, like priest. So I will punish them for their ways, And reward them for their deeds. </verse>
			<verse num="10"> For they shall eat, but not have enough; They shall commit harlotry, but not increase; Because they have ceased obeying the LORD. </verse>
			<verse num="11"> " Harlotry, wine, and new wine enslave the heart. </verse>
			<verse num="12"> My people ask counsel from their wooden [idols,] And their staff informs them. For the spirit of harlotry has caused [them] to stray, And they have played the harlot against their God. </verse>
			<verse num="13"> They offer sacrifices on the mountaintops, And burn incense on the hills, Under oaks, poplars, and terebinths, Because their shade [is] good. Therefore your daughters commit harlotry, And your brides commit adultery. </verse>
			<verse num="14"> "I will not punish your daughters when they commit harlotry, Nor your brides when they commit adultery; For [the men] themselves go apart with harlots, And offer sacrifices with a ritual harlot. Therefore people [who] do not understand will be trampled. </verse>
			<verse num="15"> " Though you, Israel, play the harlot, Let not Judah offend. Do not come up to Gilgal, Nor go up to Beth Aven, Nor swear an oath, [saying,] 'As the LORD lives' -- </verse>
			<verse num="16"> "For Israel is stubborn Like a stubborn calf; Now the LORD will let them forage Like a lamb in open country. </verse>
			<verse num="17"> "Ephraim [is] joined to idols, Let him alone. </verse>
			<verse num="18"> Their drink is rebellion, They commit harlotry continually. Her rulers dearly love dishonor. </verse>
			<verse num="19"> The wind has wrapped her up in its wings, And they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices. </verse>

		<chapter num="5">
			<verse num="1"> "Hear this, O priests! Take heed, O house of Israel! Give ear, O house of the king! For yours [is] the judgment, Because you have been a snare to Mizpah And a net spread on Tabor. </verse>
			<verse num="2"> The revolters are deeply involved in slaughter, Though I rebuke them all. </verse>
			<verse num="3"> I know Ephraim, And Israel is not hidden from Me; For now, O Ephraim, you commit harlotry; Israel is defiled. </verse>
			<verse num="4"> "They do not direct their deeds Toward turning to their God, For the spirit of harlotry is in their midst, And they do not know the LORD. </verse>
			<verse num="5"> The pride of Israel testifies to his face; Therefore Israel and Ephraim stumble in their iniquity; Judah also stumbles with them. </verse>
			<verse num="6"> "With their flocks and herds They shall go to seek the LORD, But they will not find [Him;] He has withdrawn Himself from them. </verse>
			<verse num="7"> They have dealt treacherously with the LORD, For they have begotten pagan children. Now a New Moon shall devour them and their heritage. </verse>
			<verse num="8"> " Blow the ram's horn in Gibeah, The trumpet in Ramah! Cry aloud [at] Beth Aven, '[Look] behind you, O Benjamin!' </verse>
			<verse num="9"> Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke; Among the tribes of Israel I make known what is sure. </verse>
			<verse num="10"> "The princes of Judah are like those who remove a landmark; I will pour out my wrath on them like water. </verse>
			<verse num="11"> Ephraim is oppressed [and] broken in judgment, Because he willingly walked by [human] precept. </verse>
			<verse num="12"> Therefore I [will be] to Ephraim like a moth, And to the house of Judah like rottenness. </verse>
			<verse num="13"> "When Ephraim saw his sickness, And Judah [saw] his wound, Then Ephraim went to Assyria And sent to King Jareb; Yet he cannot cure you, Nor heal you of your wound. </verse>
			<verse num="14"> For I [will be] like a lion to Ephraim, And like a young lion to the house of Judah. I, [even] I, will tear [them] and go away; I will take [them] away, and no one shall rescue. </verse>
			<verse num="15"> I will return again to My place Till they acknowledge their offense. Then they will seek My face; In their affliction they will earnestly seek Me." </verse>

		<chapter num="6">
			<verse num="1"> Come, and let us return to the LORD; For He has torn, but He will heal us; He has stricken, but He will bind us up. </verse>

			<verse num="3"> Let us know, Let us pursue the knowledge of the LORD. His going forth is established as the morning; He will come to us like the rain, Like the latter [and] former rain to the earth. </verse>

			<verse num="5"> Therefore I have hewn [them] by the prophets, I have slain them by the words of My mouth; And your judgments [are like] light [that] goes forth. </verse>

			<verse num="1"> "When I would have healed Israel, Then the iniquity of Ephraim was uncovered, And the wickedness of Samaria. For they have committed fraud; A thief comes in; A band of robbers takes spoil outside. </verse>
