It is necessary for you, therefore, to fulfill those things which have been assigned you to do, since you have been enrolled as a son of Stephen, the first deacon: to visit the people of the Lord, the widows and the orphans and the afflicted.  You shall gladden those whom you are able to help and supply their needs, being an example for them so that they might see your good works and emulate them from your behavior; following the bishop or the presbyter, informing him about the afflicted, so that he might visit them according to the canonical rules; honoring those higher than you in dignityâ€”the presbyters, since they are as a father to youâ€”so that you too might be worthy of the Blessed One who says, â€œWhoever will serve me my Father will honorâ€?; as the holy apostle Paul also says, â€œThose who have served well, it is a good rank which they have acquired for themselves and a great confidence in the faith which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.â€? Know, therefore, the measure of the honor which has been given you and bear it, which is the true blood which was given for the salvation of the world, which was given into your hands for the glory of our God, Jesus Christ our Lord.
