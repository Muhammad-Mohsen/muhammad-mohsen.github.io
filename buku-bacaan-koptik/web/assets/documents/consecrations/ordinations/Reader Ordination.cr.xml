While your son is young, give him a good education as a circumspective, wise, and experienced parent. Start his education at an early age so that he may walk in a way that conforms to this service to which he has been promoted. Encourage him and settle in his heart the desire to learn the spiritual and scientific books of this order of deaconship and the meanings of its legal laws. When he becomes mature enough, tell him about the value of the grace he has received in this order, which enlightens his mind and instincts, and establishes in him all spiritual knowledge and wisdom. Anchor in him the thought that this grace which he has received surpasses all friendships and values. Make sure that he offers God a pure and steadfast service. When he is grown up, train him in good reputable deeds, and teach him to fast the Wednesdays and Fridays and all the other fasts observed by the rest of the congregation. Insist on his attending the Liturgies so that he may obtain the blessings of sharing in the spiritual fellowship of the prayers, communion, and the offerings.             </Language>            <Language id="Arabic">               ÙˆØ§Ø¬ØªÙ‡Ø¯ Ø£ÙŠÙ‡Ø§ Ø§Ù„Ø£Ø¨Ù† Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø¨Ø§Ø±Ùƒ ÙˆØ§Ù„Ø¯Ù‡ Ø¨ØºØ§ÙŠØ© Ø§Ù„Ù‡Ø¨Ø©.
